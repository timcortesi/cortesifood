I LOVE eggs in squares. You can make them for breakfast on a random Saturday morning. You can make them while you're camping. You can even make them over hard and then use the egg in a square to make a BLT! Only then it's called a BLET, because egg. If you add avocado to your sandwich then its a BLEAT. Sourdough bread is especially delicious for this sandwich. I know. Mind blown. #gentus #evenmoregeniusthanmysisteronpage4 

- Butter
- 4 slices of bread- 4 eggs
- Jam (For serving)

Butter the bread. Use a round biscuit cutter or glass or just eye ball it to cut a ~3 inch diameter circle into each slice of bread. Remove the circle. Place 2 squares, (margarine side down) in a greased, warmed, frying pan, and crack an egg into the center hole of each. Cook as you would a fried egg, turning entire square/egg when almost done. Set aside and cover. Repeat with the other 2 slices of bread and eggs. Lightly brown cut out circles on each side as well. Serve together with jam. Make sure Mom gets hers ASAP because she does NOT like cold eggs.
