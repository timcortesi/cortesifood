So I haven't actually made this. But doesn't it sound like something we should make?? I think I cut it out of a brochure from a local wine store (Total Wine). We should definitely try it. Katrina and Stephanie .. Wilkens Fruit & Fir Farm Frosé?? 

- 1 750 ml bottle dry rosé
- 2 cups fresh strawberries
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 cup vodka
- 2 tablespoons grenadine syrup

Divide rosé in ice cube trays and freeze solid, 8 hours or overnight. Then place strawberries and sugar in the bowl of a blender and let sit 10 minutes. Add vodka, grenadine syrup, and rosé cubes. Blend on high until smooth. Pour into glasses, garnish with additional strawberries, and enjoy. 

Side note. No, I didn't make a beverages section of this cookbook. But this makes me very sad. Book 3 is definitely going to have an Adult Beverages section. So send me instructions to make all your favorites!!
