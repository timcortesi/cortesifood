This is essentially the same recipe for peach cobbler as is on [page 176](John_Geibels_Gravy_for_a_Crowd.md) of your other Cortesi Family Recipes cookbook, but you are making it in a cast iron dutch oven (large pot with handle and cover). If Tyler will be eating this, make sure you bring an extra can of whipped cream for him, or you won't get any. 

1 32 ounce can sliced peaches (or more) Cornstarch 
Bisquick 
Sugar 
Milk 
Cinnamon 
Cinnamon-sugar 
Whipped cream 

Combine the peaches, sugar, cornstarch & cinnamon in the dutch oven. Mix up the Bisquick and sugar and milk, and drop blobs onto the fruit in the pot, and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Cover the dutch oven, and place it right into the hot coals of a campfire (keeping it level), and pile more coals on top of the lid. Let it cook for about 20 min, then check to see if cobbler biscuits are done. Serve with whipped cream.
