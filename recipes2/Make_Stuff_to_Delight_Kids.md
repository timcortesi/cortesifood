All of these are fun texture things that kids like to both play with and help mix up themselves. Some of them can get kind of messy so you might want to send them outside for the mixing and/or playing. You can find various versions of these (and other similar things to make) all over the Interwebs. Extra credit to both Aunt Wendy and my mother in law for making stuff like this with my kids (thanks!) 

1 cup of yogurt (strawberry flavor is fun, just make sure there are no chunks of fruit!) 3/4 cups of corn starch 

Mix yogurt and corn starch. When the mixture is no longer sticky, pick it up and roll the putty into a ball (to further mix the yogurt and corn starch). If it’s too sticky, sprinkle in additional corn starch. If it’s too dry, add a bit more yogurt. 

- Gak:
- 2 - 4 ounce bottles Elmers glue- 1 1/2 cups warm water, divided- Food coloring
- 1 teaspoon borax

Empty both glue bottles in a glass bowl. Fill the empty glue bottles with warm water, then add that water to the bowl. Add food coloring. Mix borax with additional 1/2 cup of warm water until dissolved.

Gak (continued): 
Add the borax/water mixture to the glue mix and stir until it comes together into a weird goo. Find some kids and let them have at it. Store in an airtight container when they're done. 

Slime: 
Clear school glue 
Equal amount liquid starch (sold near the laundry detergent in your favorite grocery store) 
Fun additions of your choosing - food coloring, glitter (the website I read recommended Discount School Supply's plastic glitter), glow in the dark paint (you can buy this from Michael's), etc 

Let your kid mix equal parts clear school glue with liquid starch until its nice and gooey. If it is too sticky add more starch. If itis too slimy add more glue. Play with it as is, or if you like, divide it into smaller portions and add food coloring, glitter, glow in the dark paint, etc. 

lime without Borax/Starch: (an alternative recipe in case you don't have that stuff) 1 container (4 ounces) Elmer's glue (white or glitter) 1/2 tablespoon of baking soda 1 to 1 1/4 tablespoon of contact solution 

Empty the entire contents of the glue bottle into a bowl. Add the baking soda and mix. Add the contact solution 

and mix again until mixture begins to get harder to mix. 

(continued on next page)
Gak/Slime without Borax/Starch (continued): 
Take the slime out of the bowl and begin kneading with both of your hands. If needed, add an additional 1/4 tablespoon contact solution to make the slime less sticky. 

loud Dough: 8 cups flour 1 cup oil (vegetable works fine Food coloring (optional) 

Dump (or scoop, pour, whatever) the flour into the middle of a large tupperware tub. Dig a hole in the middle. Pour in the oil. Mix it all together until the dough holds together when you squeeze it. If desired, portion into smaller quantities and add food coloring. Get out measuring cups, spoons, bowls, cookie cutters, whatever, and play. Store in an air tight container when they're done. 

Puffy Paint: Self rising flour - buy, or make your own: 

- 1 cup all purpose flour- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Food coloring
- Salt
- Water

Combine equal parts self rising flour and salt (like maybe start with 1 tablespoon of each in a small bowl or squirt 

bottle). Add a little bit of water. 

(continued on next page)
Puffy Paint (continued): 

(start with 1/4 teaspoon per color) and stir until you get a smooth thin paste (about the same consistency as stirred yogurt). Add food coloring as desired. 

Paint with squirt bottles, paintbrushes, q-tips, or whatever. When you are ready, put your art in the microwave for 30 seconds and watch it puffup! Pretty cool, huh?
