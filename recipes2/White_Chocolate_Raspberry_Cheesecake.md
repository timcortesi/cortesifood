Mom loves this kind of cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. When Rachel made this she used a food mill to get the seeds out of the raspberries, and she also mixed all of the raspberry sauce into the cake instead of saving some to put on the top. I say why not just go buy a piece from Cheesecake Factory instead of spending forever making this whole thing but to each their own... 

- 1 cup chocolate cookie crumbs
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 cups white chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup half-and-half cream
- 3 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla
- Whipped cream
- 2 oz shaved white chocolate (optional)

In a medium bowl, mix together cookie crumbs, 3 tablespoons sugar, and melted butter. Press mixture into 

the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.

In a saucepan, combine raspberries, 2 tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, and water. Bring to boil, and continue boiling 5 minutes, or until sauce is thick. Strain sauce through a mesh strainer to remove seeds. 

In a large bowl, mix together cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in vanilla and melted white chocolate. Pour half of batter over crust. Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Pour remaining cheesecake batter into pan, and again spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over the top. Swirl batter with the tip of a knife to create a marbled effect. 

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until filling is set. Cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 hours before removing from pan. Serve with remaining raspberry sauce, whipped cream, and shaved white chocolate. 

Serves 8-12.
