These are those little white cookies that we used to put the pieces of red and green candied cherries in the top of. Mom's name for them is "Pecan Drops". I have no idea where you find green candied cherries. Mom thinks she used to get them from a fruitcake mix. I recall them coming in a clear plastic container with a white lid but I have no idea where that came from. #youareafruitcake 

- 1 cup margarine
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 confectioner sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- Candied cherries, cut into pieces (quarters?)

Blend together butter, salt, sugar and vanilla. Add flour and pecans, mix well. Chill. 

Once dough is chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Shape into small balls; place on baking sheet. Press center in with fingertip to form small hole. Insert piece of cherry in each. Bake for 15 minutes. 

Makes 5 dozen.
