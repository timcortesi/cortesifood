John Geibel makes some of the best baked potatoes I've ever had. Maybe its the side of sarcasm he serves them with. When I asked him how he makes them he said "Grab a pen it's really complicated". 

Potatoes Olive oil Salt 

Preheat oven to 350. Poke potatoes a few times with a fork. Rub with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 75 minutes.

**Becky Rant:**
After Elizabeth didn't crack her head open on [page 155](Steamed_Apples.md), because again, pro mom, I kept all the kids alive and then Tyler came home and then we all made fish sticks (and broccoli and applesauce) for dinner and then we bathed the kids and got them in pajamas and brushed their teeth and opened a countdown to Christmas book and read more books and nursed the baby and put all the kids to bed and cuddled and now here I am still working on this cookbook. Hooray! Maybe I'll open some wine. And no the fish sticks recipe is not in this cookbook sorry, better luck in Book 3. It's on page 96 of the cookbook Kid Chef Bakes. Which you can obtain from Amazon if you really want the fish stick recipe. #herefishyfishy
