This recipe is from the book Kid Chef Bakes and is something my kids really enjoyed making. 

- For the dough:
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (105-115 degrees F)
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 (1/4 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- 4 to 4 1/2 cups all purpose flour, plus extra for surface- 2 tablespoons table salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil
- Baking spray or parchment paper

- For the water bath and topping:
- 8 cups water
- 1/2 cup baking soda
- 1 egg yolk
- 1-2 teaspoons pretzel or coarse salt

Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer with the hook attachment on, stir together water, sugar, and yeast until blended, then let sit for about 5 minutes. Then add about 3 1/2 cups of the flour, salt, and the melted butter to the bowl. Mix on low until well blended. Add more flour as needed for the dough to come together. Raise the speed to medium and continue kneading for 4-6 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic. Grease a large bowl with the oil, add the dough, turn it to coat, cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place to double in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 450. Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper. 

Prepare the water bath: In a large saucepan over high heat, add the 8 cups of water and baking soda. Bring to a boil and stir to blend. 

Form the pretzel sticks: Place the risen dough on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half, then divide each half into 12 balls, for a total of 24 balls. Roll out each ball into a rope 4-5 inches long. Dust off any excess flour from the pretzels. 

Gently lower each pretzel into the boiling water, 2 or 3 ata time, and cook for 20-30 seconds. Remove the pretzels with a large slotted spoon or spatula, gently shaking off any excess water, then place the pretzels on the baking sheets. Mix the egg yolk with a little water to thin in a small bowl. With a pastry brush, lightly brush the egg yolk on top of the pretzels, then sprinkle with the pretzel or coarse salt. 

Bake for 12-17 minutes, or until dark golden brown. Cool slightly, then transfer the pretzels to a wire rack to finish cooling before serving.
