Everyone's favorite baby has only gotten more awake since we last caught up with her on [page 37](Rachels_Tortilla_Pinwheels.md). I was trying to get her to rest quietly next to me on the bed while I type, but she is instead choosing to stand up holding onto the head of my bed so she can bounce up and down happily yelling UP UP YUPPPPP at the top of her lungs.
