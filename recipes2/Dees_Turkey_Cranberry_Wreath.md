This is a recipe from Tyler's mom that I often make at Tyler's parents house in the days after Thanksgiving, using leftover turkey. It is both pretty and delicious. I think the recipe is originally from Pampered Chef. 

- 2 packages (8 ounces each) refrigerated crescent rolls- 1/2 cup mayo
- 2 tablespoons honey Dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
- 2 cups cooked turkey, chopped
- 1/2 cup celery, sliced
- 3 tablespoons fresh parsley, snipped
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 4 ounces Swiss cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)- 1/4 cup walnuts, chopped
- 1 egg white, lightly beaten

Preheat oven to 375. Unroll crescent dough; separate into 16 triangles. With wide ends of triangles toward the center, arrange 8 triangles in a circle on a large baking stone or cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. Corners should touch. Match wide ends of each remaining triangle to wide ends of each outer triangle. (I can draw you a picture of this if it is confusing.) Seal seams. 

Mix together all remaining ingredients except for egg. Scoop filling over seams of dough, forming a circle. Beginning in the center, lift one dough triangle across mixture. Continue alternating with outer strips, slightly overlapping to form wreath. Tuck last end under first. Brush egg white over dough & bake 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Serves 10.
