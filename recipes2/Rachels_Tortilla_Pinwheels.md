Rachel made these for my baby shower when I was pregnant with Henry. Excellent make ahead lunch. 

- 8 oz. dairy sour cream
- 1 package (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened
- 1 can (4 oz.) diced green chilies, well drained
- 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup chopped green onion
- "Salsa or something?" <-- verbatim from her recipe- Garlic powder to taste
- Seasoned salt to taste
- 5 (10 ") flour tortillas

Mix all of the filling ingredients together thoroughly. Divide the filling and spread evenly over the tortillas; roll up tortillas. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, twisting ends; refrigerate for several hours. Unwrap; cut in slices 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick.
