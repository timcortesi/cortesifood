- Per kid:
- 12 clean Easter eggs, preferably 1 of each of- 12 different colors
- 1 egg carton

12 different lunch/snack foods that will fit in the eggs: Baby carrots 
Celery 
Blueberries 
Strawberries 
Cubed cheese 
Rolled up ham and/or turkey 
Hershey kisses 
etc 

Put each food in each egg. I like to match the food color to the egg color because I am slightly crazy. Close all of the eggs and hide them around the yard. Give each kid an empty egg carton and instruct them to find one of each color egg. They eat once they have found all of the eggs. Have fun!
