This is my go-to bring someone a dish meal, usually with salad in a bag and some french bread. As written this makes a 9x13 pan and serves maybe 8. Sometimes instead of making a 9x13 pan I make 2 8x8 pans and freeze one. Or double it and bring someone a 9x13 and make another 9x13 for myself. 

- 1 lb uncooked penne pasta
- 1 lb hot Italian sausage (actually I usually use 1/2 Ib- sweet and 1/2 Ib hot) - either buy it in bulk as- ground sausage or in casings and then remove the- casings so its just crumbled)
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 8 oz tomato paste
- 8 oz tomato sauce (or use less paste and more sauce to- total 16 oz total, however the cans are sold)
- 1/4 teaspoon. salt
- 1/4 teaspoon. black pepper
- 2 - 14 oz cans diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
- 3 cups shredded/grated Italian-ish cheese (the original
- recipe called for 1 cup each of mozzarella, parmesan, and
- Italian fontal, but I just use whatever mix of stuff I can
- find. Often I get a shredded Italian mix and then add some
- parmesan as well)

(instructions on the next page)
(Preheat oven to 350 if you plan to eat this today.) Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and oil. Drain pasta and set aside. 

Remove casings from sausage if needed. Cook sausage, onion, and garlic in a large (very large, you're going to add more stuff) nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, stirring to crumble. Drain. Add tomato paste, tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine cooked pasta, sausage mixture, and basil (I use a large bow! for this as I can't fit it all in one skillet). 

Place half of the pasta mixture in a 9x13 baking dish. Top w/half of the (mixed) cheese. Repeat layers. Then either cool and freeze it (tightly wrapped in saran wrap and foil) and then to serve later thaw slightly and bake at 350 for ~30 minutes or until bubbly, or if you're not freezing it you just bake it right now, I do about 20 minutes. Everything is already cooked so you're pretty much just melting the cheese. 

Serves... I don't know, 6-8ish? Depends how hungry everyone is. And if Dad is one of the everyones. #pastapastatimetoeatyourpasta #andcheese
