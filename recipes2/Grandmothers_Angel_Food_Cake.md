The Wilkens family used to eat this with strawberries & whipped cream for Aunt Tricia's birthday. 

- 1 cup egg whites (about 8)- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 5 egg yolks
- 1 cup flour
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract- 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Heat oven to 325. Beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a mixer bowl on medium speed until foamy. Beat in 1 cup of the sugar on high speed, 1 tablespoon at a time; continue beating until stiff and glossy, forming peaks. Do not underbeat. Reserve. 

Beat egg yolks in a small mixer bowl until very thick and lemon colored - about 5 min. Beat in remaining 1/2 cup sugar gradually. Beat in flour alternately with water and flavorings on low speed. Fold (cut down through center of beaten egg whites (with spatula), along bottom, and up side; rotate 1/4 turn. Repeat) egg yolk mixture into reserved meringue. Spread in ungreased (separating) tube pan, 10x4 inches. 

(continued on next page)
Cut gently through batter with metal spatula to break down large air pickets and to seal batter against side of pan and tube). 

Bake until top springs back when touched lightly, 60- 
65 minutes. (Cracks should feel dry; no imprint should remain). Invert pan on funnel or bottle so cake does not touch the counter; let hang until cake is cold. Remove. Top with fruit and whipped cream, if desired.

Sorry to leave you hanging on [page 203](More_Lactation_Cookies.md). Will Ferrell just accidentally cut down one of those cell phone towers that is supposed to look like a Christmas tree, while the family was out trying to cut down a Christmas tree. And then someone made a "can you hear me now?" joke. HAHAHAHAHA this movie is hilarious. Did you guys know that Will Ferrell's actual name is John? Look it up.
