This is another delicious Pratt family Christmas cookie recipe. Enjoy! 

- 1 package (6 ounces) semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 2 tablespoons maraschino cherry juice
- 1 package Duncan Hines chocolate chip cookie mix
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup chopped maraschino cherries (well drained)- 42 maraschino cherry halves (well drained) for garnish

Preheat oven to 350F. Make fudge filling: combine chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk and cherry juice in small sauce pan. Heat on low heat until chocolate chips are melted, stirring until smooth. Set aside. 

Combine cookie mix, contents of buttery flavor packet from mix, and egg in large bowl. Stir until thoroughly blended. Stir in chopped maraschino cherries. 

Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls, 2 inches apart, onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 350F for 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Drop 1 rounded teaspoon fudge filling onto top of each partially baked cookie. Top each with cherry half. Bake 4-5 minutes longer or until edges are light golden brown. Cool 2 minutes on cookie sheets. Remove to cooling racks. Cool completely. Store between layers of waxed paper in airtight container. 

Makes about 3 1/2 dozen cookies.
