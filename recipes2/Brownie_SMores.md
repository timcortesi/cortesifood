I think this idea is from a Family Fun magazine. Brownies + s'mores combined into a single gooey dessert is an excellent idea. 

1 box brownie mix (plus any ingredients) Enough graham crackers to cover an 8x8 pan Enough mini marshmallows to cover an 8x8 pan 

Follow instructions on box to preheat oven and prepare brownie mix. Spread half of the brownie batter in an 8x8 inch pan. Cover with graham crackers. Top with remaining batter. Bake as directed. Top with mini marshmallows; broil to brown slightly.
