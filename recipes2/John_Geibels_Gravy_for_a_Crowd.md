Sometimes when the Kramers visit the Geibels for another Crazy Kram-eibel Adventure, Geibel makes us a delicious dinner. This is a gravy he made that I loved so much last fall that I asked him for the recipe. It makes a lot so use at least a 4 quart pan). 

- 4 cups liquid (drippings, stock, broth, whatever)- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 3 cups diced onion
- 1/2 cup flour
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- Few dashes white pepper
- 2 tablespoons cognac
- 2 tablespoons wine
- Splash of sherry vinegar

Warm 4 cups base liquid(s). At the same time in a separate pot, melt butter over medium low. Add diced onion to the butter and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Slowly whisk into butter the flour, salt, and peppers. Brown, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Slowly whisk in liquids. Simmer 4-5 minutes to thicken. Add cognac, wine, and sherry vinegar. Season further as desired and serve.
