Tyler found this recipe in the New York Times. It is really good if you like citrus fruits like Ido. You can also add pomelos if you can find them. What is a pomelo? Its a citrus fruit. Clearly. 

- 2 blood oranges or tangerines
- 1 pink grapefruit
- 1 navel orange
- Salt
- 1/2 small red onion or 1 shallot, chopped
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon honey
- Lime or lemon juice to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly chopped tarragon or pinch dried

Peel citrus, removing as much pith as possible, and slice into wheels. Remove any pits, layer fruit on a serving dish, sprinkle with salt and garnish with chopped onion. 

Whisk together olive oil, vinegar, honey, lime juice and tarragon until well combined; taste, adjust seasoning as needed and drizzle over salad.
