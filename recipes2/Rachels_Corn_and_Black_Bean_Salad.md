Serve with the Grilled Cuban Pork Ribs recipe that is also in this cookbook (see [page 140](PreVegetarian_Rachels_Grilled_Cuban_Pork_Ribs.md)). Andrew has a different version of a black bean and corn salad you can also try (see the page after this one). #rachel #andrew #whosewillbebetter #cookbook #hashtags #butseriouslywhydopeopleusethese
