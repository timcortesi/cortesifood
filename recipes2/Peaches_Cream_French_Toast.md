I love peaches. Millions of peaches, peaches for me! (I also love music from the 90s.) I found this recipe on myrecipes.com. What is below is slightly modified (more peaches!). Serves 8 as written, or if you are serving 4 you can can halve the whole recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan. 

- 1 8-oz. loaf French bread, sliced
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 40 oz. sliced peaches, drained if using canned (I used- Mom's canned peaches and they were great!)
- 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

Put pam in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange bread in a tight, flat layer in dish. In a large bowl, whisk eggs with milk, sugar and vanilla until blended; pour over bread. Arrange peaches on top and sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. 

Remove baking dish from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Pour cream into a small pan; bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Drizzle over peaches and bake, uncovered, until casserole is lightly browned on top and just cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
