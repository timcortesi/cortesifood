I really, really like this when Tyler makes it, and I don't usually even really like squash that much. But this is delicious. #yum #really 
Also, squash makes me think of A GREAT BIG SQUASH JUST SAT UPON MY HAT. Ask Rachel. She'll sing it. 

2 delicata squash 
Olive oil 
Salt and pepper 
Sage, minced (optional) 
Maple syrup (optional) 
Shallots, sliced lengthwise (optional) 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Slice squash in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Slice into half rings. Toss with olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Add minced sage if using. Spread in single layer on foil covered cookie sheet. 

Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove and flip, drizzle with maple syrup if desired. Add sliced shallots to pan if desired. Return to oven and roast for another 15-20 minutes.
