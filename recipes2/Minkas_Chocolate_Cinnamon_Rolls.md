This recipe is from the book "The Storyteller", by Jodi Picoult. It's a pretty good book if you haven't read it. Mom also loves "Small Great Things" by the same author. Anyway, these rolls are featured in "The Storyteller" and sounded delicious, so I saved the recipe but I haven't actually tried it yet. #read #allthebooks #alsochocolate #allthechocolate #andallthehashtags 

- 1/2 cup warm milk, 110 degrees Fahrenheit
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup sugar, plus a pinch
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 cups all purpose flour plus more for work surface
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for bowl and- muffin tins
- 1/4 pound bittersweet chocolate, very finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon

Pour warm milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast and pinch of sugar over milk; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. In a bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, and 1 egg yolk. Add egg mixture to yeast mixture, and whisk to combine. 

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine flour and salt. Add egg mixture, and 

beat on low speed until almost all the flour is incorporated.

Change to the dough hook. Add 3 tablespoons butter, and knead on low speed until flour mixture and butter are completely incorporated, about 10 minutes. Dough will be sticky. 

Butter a large bowl. Place dough in bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a dish towel. Set aside in a warm place to rise until dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. A simple trick to help warm your dough is to place a large pan of boiling water on the lowest rack in your oven and place the bowl of dough on the next highest rack. 

Prepare filling: Place chocolate, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon in a large bowl; stir to combine. Add 3 tablespoons butter and toss. Set aside. 

Once dough has doubled, turn onto a well-floured surface and deflate. Let dough rest for 5 minutes. 

With rolling pin, roll dough into large rectangular shape. Sprinkle filling over dough, roll the dough into a log and slice into 2 inch pieces. Butter cups of the muffin tin. Place each slide in a cup. Cover muffin tin with plastic wrap and let sit 15-20 minutes or until dough rises slightly. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for approximately 12-15 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
