These are delicious at Panera but they often sell out if you don't get there early enough. Now you can make your own! Aren't you excited?! Panera has other versions too (like four cheese, and also I think there is one with ham) so feel free to experiment with the ingredients. 

- 3 tablespoons frozen spinach, thawed
- 4 slices bacon, cooked & crumbled
- 2 teaspoons minced onion
- 1 teaspoon minced red bell pepper
- 5 eggs
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese- 1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 8-ounce tube Pillsbury Crescent butter flake dough- Melted butter
- 1/4 cup shredded Asiago cheese

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine spinach, bacon, onion, and red bell pepper in a small bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of water, cover bowl with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in the plastic. Microwave on high for 3 minutes. Beat 4 eggs. Mix in milk, cream, cheddar cheese, Jack cheese, Parmesan, and salt. Stir in spinach, artichoke, onion, and bell pepper. Microwave egg mixture for 30 seconds on high, and then stir it. Do this 4 to 5 more times or until you have a very runny scrambled egg mixture. (continued on next page)
This process will tighten up the eggs enough so that the dough won't sink into the eggs when it's folded over. 

Unroll and separate the crescent dough into four rectangles (not triangles). Use some flour on the dough and roll across the width of the rectangle with a rolling pin so that each piece of dough stretches out into a 6x6" square. 

Brush melted butter inside four 4" inch baking dishes or ramekins. (If you prefer you can use 6" ramekins instead and then just double all the filling ingredients that follow, and extend the baking time by 5 minutes.) Line each dish with the dough, then spoon in equal amounts of egg mixture. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of asiago cheese on top of the egg mixture and then gently fold the dough over the mixture. Beat the last egg in a small bowl, then brush beaten egg over the top of the dough in each ramekin. 

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until dough is brown. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes, then carefully 

remove the souffl√©s from each ramekin and serve hot. 

Serves 4.
