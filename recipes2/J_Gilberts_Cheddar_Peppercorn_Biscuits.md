This recipe is from a restaurant that Tyler and I like to go to sometimes for date night. (When we go on date night. Which is not as often as we would like.) This restaurant also make a really good salmon appetizer (see [page 50](J_Gilberts_Smoked_Salmon_Rillette.md)). 

- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups cake flour
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 tablespoon baking powder- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper- 1/2 pound shredded cheddar cheese- 1/2 pound salted butter
- 2 cups buttermilk
- For serving: whipped butter, drizzled with maple syrup- and Maldon sea salt

Mix together both flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pepper, and cheddar. Cut the butter into the flour mix, taking care NOT to overwork - butter should be left in small pieces. Pour in buttermilk and stir just until mixture comes together - do not overmix. Roll and cut biscuits using additional flour on your surface to prevent sticking. Bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet at 375 degrees for 15-18 minutes. 

Serve with whipped butter, drizzled with maple syrup and Maldon sea salt.
