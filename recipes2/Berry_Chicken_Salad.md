Basically there is no real recipe for this but it is a salad combination that I love, so I'm including it. P.S. If you're into salads, check out [page 259](Assemble_A_Salad.md). 

Greens (spinach, arugula, spring mix, etc) 
Sliced cooked chicken (buy or make a rotisserie chicken, cut off, and slice up the chicken breasts) 
Berries (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries) 
Cheese (cubed havarti or crumbled goat cheese) 
Nuts (candied pecans or almonds) 
Dressing (whatever you feel like: balsamic vinegar and olive oil, or a citrus honey blend, etc) 
Salt and pepper 

Combine all and serve with crusty bread.
