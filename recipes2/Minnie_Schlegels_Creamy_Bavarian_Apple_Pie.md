This is Tyler's grandmother's (his mom's mom's) recipe. In 1990 it won first prize in the state out of 59 entries at the Pennsylvania State Farm Show! The contest was only open to first place winners from local fairs from the year before; she had won the apple pie contest at the Reading Fair. 

- 1/2 cup butter or margarine- 1/2 + 2/3 cup sugar, divided- 1 1/4 tsp vanilla, divided
- 1 cup flour
- 4 cups thinly sliced apples- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Mix butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and flour well until mixture forms soft ball. Press into the bottom and up sides of a deep greased 9" pie pan. 

Beat together cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar. When smooth, add egg and 1 tsp vanilla. When smooth pour into pan over crust and refrigerate. 

Combine apples, cinnamon, and sugar. Layer evenly over cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle pecans over top of apples. Cover with foil and bake pie for 20 minutes. Remove foil and reduce heat to 350 degrees; bake for 35 minutes or until apples are done.
