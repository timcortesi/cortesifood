When Tyler makes this it's really good. However, the recipe he wrote down doesn't actually specify all of the ingredients or quantities or give complete instructions, so if this is too hard to follow you can just make my version (one page back). #mineisbetter 

- 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 1 cup Trader Joe's brown rice medley
- 1/4 cup Trader Joe's harvest couscous
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4+ cup wine (Tyler recommends Gewiirztraminer)- 2 tablespoons dried porcini mushrooms
- 1/2 cup water
- Herbs (rosemary, parsley, basil)
- 2 large zucchini, halved
- Miscellaneous veggies (6 ish grape tomatoes)
- 1 1/2 cups chicken broth
- Parmesan cheese

Fry sausage in oil; remove when done. Add onion and carrots to pan and saute. Add (uncooked) rice, couscous, and garlic, and saute 1-2 minutes. Add wine and deglaze. Add reconstituted mushrooms, broth, water, and rosemary. Cook about 35 minutes until done. Preheat oven to 375. Dice 1/2 zucchini into 1" pieces and add to pan with chopped tomatoes and remaining herbs. Spread mixture in greased 9x13" pan to cover. Add zucchini halves and fill with mixture. Cover with parmesan cheese and bake (add more liquid if needed) covered for 40 minutes. Remove foil and cook for 10 more minutes.
