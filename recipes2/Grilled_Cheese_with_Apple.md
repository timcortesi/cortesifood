This is the recipe for my kids' favorite grilled cheese. 
Even Mr. Henry "I don't like cheese" Kramer likes this one! Thanks to Rachel for introducing us to Sweet Hot Mr Mustard. 

Bread 
Mayo 
Sweet Hot Mr Mustard 
Cheese (whatever you have on hand - American melts well, and/or try Gruyere or Fontina) 
Apple, sliced very thinly 
Deli ham or turkey, if you feel like it 
Butter 

Spread mayo on one side of one slice of bread, and mustard on one side of the other. Assemble sandwich with cheese and apple, and meat if you are using that. Butter both outer sides of the bread. Cook on the stove, preferably in a cast iron pan, preferably while weighted, until golden brown and delicious.
