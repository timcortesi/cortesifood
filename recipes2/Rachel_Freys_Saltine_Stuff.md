This recipe comes from my college friend Rachel. (The one who married Tyler's college friend Jesse. Also the one who gave our kids their name stools.) Anyway, it is a really good snack and you can use different colored sprinkles to customize it for any holiday or event you feel like. If Adelyn was making it she would use rainbow sprinkles. Because Adelyn LOVES rainbows. And sprinkles. #whodoesnt 

- 1 sleeve saltines
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
- 1 bag chocolate chips
- Toppings of your choosing, for example: sprinkles,- crushed peppermint, nuts, toffee (heath) bits, coconut

Line a baking sheet with tin foil & spray with Pam. Line with saltines so that they are touching & flat; break edge crackers as needed to cover the entire sheet. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Melt brown sugar & butter in small saucepan, stirring constantly until smooth. Pour over the saltine mixture (it won't totally cover everything). Bake for 7 minutes. Remove from oven & sprinkle chocolate chips over the top. Let sit for 1 minute and spread with spatula. Sprinkle with toppings as desired. Refrigerate and let cool. Break into pieces; can store in a plastic bag.
