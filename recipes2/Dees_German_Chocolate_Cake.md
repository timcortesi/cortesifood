This recipe is from Tyler's mom. Apparently it is actually Gram Kramer's recipe. And no one knows how to recreate Gram Kramer's icing. Good luck to you in your attempts. 

- 1 Baker's German Chocolate Bar
- Ingredients to make the cake (whatever it says on the- bar wrapper)
- 5 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 cup granulated sugar.

Follow the recipe on the wrapper of the bar to make the cake. Let cool. 

Prepare the icing as follows (maybe): Combine flour and milk in small sauce pan. Whisk together to avoid lump. Bring to a boil until thick and let cool. Add butter, vanilla, and sugar and beat until fluffy. 

Ty's mom says she always has a problem with the icing getting too runny. Tyler's cousin Scott says he adds a little water. Sometime's Tyler's mom refrigerates the icing so it hardens a little. 

Spread the icing on the cooled cake, invite the Kramer family over, and enjoy.
