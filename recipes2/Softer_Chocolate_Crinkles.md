I don't know if I do something wrong or not, but whenever I make the recipe for chocolate crinkles from Book 1 (the recipe that we grew up using), my cookies end up like hockey pucks. I like this recipe way better - it is both easier (starts with a cake mix) and results in way moister cookies. I suspect because it uses a "there's pudding in the mix!" cake mix. Anyway, here's the recipe. 

- 1 package Betty Crocker super moist devil's food- cake mix
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- Granulated sugar

Preheat oven to 350. Mix cake mix, oil, and eggs with spoon until dough forms. Shape into 1" balls; roll in sugar. Bake 8-10 minutes. Cool 1-2 minutes on cookie sheet, then finish cooling on wire rack.

Important life update. I know you've been on the edge of your seat since [page 235](Dees_Creamy_Jello_Jigglers.md). Rachel is texting me pictures of her face wearing a weird black "Blaq" undereye mask thing. She looks soooo goood. Seriously. I wish I could include a picture in here. You'll have to imagine it. Also Tyler is telling me about how he can grow a better beard than Mark Wahlberg. And the movie is gearing up for a big finish with everyone singing.
