From an email Mom wrote me in July 2009: 
"K - Rachel made this for us for dinner last night. I think it was probably the best dinner at home that I've EVER had - ever... absolutely incredible!!" So I guess these are good! According to the email Rachel served them with white rice and the Corn and Black Bean salad also in this cookbook, see [page 164](Rachels_Corn_and_Black_Bean_Salad.md). 

- Cuban Rub:
- 2 tablespoons grated lime peel (optional)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- Pork Ribs:
- 4 boneless pork loin country style ribs, about 1 inch- thick (about 2 pounds)
- 1/4 of a whole mango, peeled, and thinly sliced

Remove excess fat from pork. In small bowl, mix all Cuban Rub ingredients; rub evenly on both sides of pork. Cover and grill pork 4-6 inches from med heat for 8-10 minutes, turning frequently, until pork is no longer pink inside (about 160 degrees on meat thermometer). Garnish with mango slices. (Note: Cuban Rub also great on chicken breasts or pork chops).
