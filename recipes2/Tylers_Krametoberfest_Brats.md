Tyler makes a mean brat, which you will know if you have ever attended Krametoberfest at our house. If you haven't, you are missing out and you definitely should come next year. We play polka music. 

- 4 slices of bacon, roughly chopped
- Two small apples (Tyler likes to use Golden delicious- or Granny Smith), diced
- 1-2 onions, sliced
- 2 pounds of sauerkraut, drained
- 1 bottle of lager
- Two bay leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon Herbes de Provence (from Trader Joe's,- or you can use thyme if you don't have this)
- 5 juniper berries
- 10 peppercorns
- About 2 pounds of brats plus rolls for each

Saute bacon. Add onion and saute that too. When the onion is sauted, add sauerkraut, beer, apples, and remaining spices. Bring to a simmer. Add brats once simmering. After brats are cooked (takes about 10 minutes), turn the temperature down and let them sit for a while if you are not in arush. Feel free to take a break to bounce on the Krametoberfest bounce house. When you are ready to eat, cook the brats on a medium grill for about 3 minutes per side to crisp them up. Serve in rolls topped with sauerkraut mixture and spicy brown mustard.
