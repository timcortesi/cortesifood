These are delicious. You can alternatively make them with whatever random vegetables you feel like, or black beans, or whatever. Mom recommends serving with Grilled Quesadillas (couple pages back) and Apple Cake (couple pages forward).

- 5 medium unpeeled thinly sliced potatoes- 1 (16 ounce) bag frozen green beans
- 1 (16 ounce) bag frozen corn
- 2 medium peeled, sliced onions
- Parsley flakes
- Salt and pepper to taste

Cut rectangular piece of heavy duty aluminum foil large enough to allow for folding at the top and sides; spray with pam; place all ingredients except cheese in the center. Bring the long edges of foil together over the center. Fold them down in a series of locked folds, allowing room for heat expansion. Fold in the outside edges, crimping to seal. Place in fire, 4-6‚Äù from hot coals, or right on med coals. Turn carefully with long tongs after about 15 minutes. Cook about 15 minutes more, checking for done- ness. Open carefully, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Enjoy.
