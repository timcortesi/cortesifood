This recipe is from Cooking Light and is very good. I know, that is like the boringest intro ever. I'm tired. Here's a joke. Why is 6 afraid of 7? Because 7 8 9! 

- 4 cups peeled, cubed sweet potato (about 2 medium)- 3 1/2 cups water, divided
- 2 cups dried red lentils
- 2 cups low-sodium fat-free vegetable broth
- 3/4 cup finely chopped white onion
- 3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste (Thai Kitchen)- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger
- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 1 tablespoon sugar, divided
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 (6-0z.) can tomato paste
- 1 cup canned light coconut milk
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup very thinly sliced red onion
- 4 cups hot cooked brown rice
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves

Place sweet potato, 3 cups water, and next 7 ingredients (through tumeric) in a 5-6 quart electric slower cooker coated with cooking spray. Add 1 teaspoon sugar, salt, garlic, and tomato paste; stir well to combine. Cover and cook on low 8 hours. Turn off heat; stir in coconut milk. Let stand, covered, 5 minutes.

Combine remaining 1/2 cup water, remaining 2 teaspoons sugar, and vinegar in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave at high 2 minutes or until boiling. 

Add onion to vinegar mixture; let stand 20 minutes at room temperature. Drain. 

Place 1/2 cup rice in each of 8 shallow bowls. Top each serving with 1 1/4 cups lentil mixture, 2 tablespoons red 

onion mixture, and 2 tablespoons cilantro. 

Serves 8.
