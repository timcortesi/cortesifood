This is another one I don't remember but Mom says we made. It has a colored batter inside with white dough on the outside, shaped into a bell (or a star or whatever). 

- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Mix butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla thoroughly. Stir flour, baking soda, and salt together and blend into rest of dough. Separately dough into three equal portions. Color one third of the dough red and one third green. Mold each color into a 10 x 1 1/2" roll. Mold this roll into a bell shape by squeezing the top together and leaving the lower half flared and curving. Wrap in saran wrap and chill. 

Save 1/4 of the white dough for bell clappers (form 60 small balls and chill). Roll out the rest of the dough on waxed paper into two rectangles large enough to cover the colored rolls, about 5x4". Wrap around the chilled colored rolls, trimming the edges. Chill. 

Preheat oven to 375. Cut 1/8" thick slices with a very sharp knife. Place 1/2" apart on ungreased baking sheet and add tiny ball of dough at the bottom for a clapper. Bake 7-8 minutes or until light golden in color. 

Makes 4-5 dozen cookies.
