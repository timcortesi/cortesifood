Dad loves stuffed shells. He doesn't love goat. Like that one > 

- 1 box jumbo pasta shells
- Spaghetti sauce with or without added browned- ground beef (but not goat) and onions
- 3 cups ricotta cheese
- 1 1/2 pound mozzarella cheese, cut into â€™2 inch cubes
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 2 eggs, beaten

Cook pasta according to package directions. Cool in cold water. In a large mixing bowl, combine ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses with beaten eggs. Spread about 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce in bottom of glass 9x13 baking dish. Using a spoon, scoop the filling, stuff into each shell, and place in baking dish, open side up. When dish is full, put some goat-free spaghetti sauce over the top, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze, or cover with aluminum foil and heat in 350 degree oven until warm and bubbly in the center (approximately 1 hour). This dish goes well with salad and garlic bread.
