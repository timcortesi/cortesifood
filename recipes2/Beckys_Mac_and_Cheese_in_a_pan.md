This recipe is very similar to the Dee's Mac and Cheese recipe on the page before this one, only this recipe is cooked in a glass pan in the oven instead of in a crock pot, and cooks in only half an hour instead of two and a half hours. For whatever reason I usually end of making this one instead of the crock pot version, but both are delicious. Neither are remotely healthy. 

- 2 cups 4% cottage cheese
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- Garlic salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 package (7 ounces) elbow macaroni, cooked and drained- Paprika, optional

In a large bowl, combine the cottage cheese, sour cream, egg, salt, garlic salt and pepper. Add cheddar cheese; mix well. Add macaroni and stir until coated. 
Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 25-30 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with paprika if desired. 

Serves 8-10.
