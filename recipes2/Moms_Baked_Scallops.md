Mom found this recipe on allrecipes.com in 2013. She served it with sugar snap peas, chunky applesauce, and rice pilaf, and says it was "REALLY good". On the website they served it over pasta (spaghetti or angel hair), topped with parsley and with a lemon wedge on the side. 

- 4 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 1/2 pounds bay scallops, rinsed and drained- 1/2 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Pour melted butter into a 2 quart oval casserole dish. Distribute butter and scallops evenly inside the dish. 

Combine the bread crumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, parsley, minced garlic and Parmesan cheese. 

Sprinkle this mixture over the scallops. 

Bake in pre-heated oven until scallops are firm, about 20 minutes.
