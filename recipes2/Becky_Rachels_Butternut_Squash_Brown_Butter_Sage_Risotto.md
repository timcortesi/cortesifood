The best part about this recipe is frizzling the sage. Rachel & [are pro sage frizzlers. This recipe is originally from Serious Eats. When we made it we didn't have miso so we just skipped that. I think we skipped the red pepper flakes too because we didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids. If you like you can prep this (through pureeing the squash) on the weekend and then just quickly finish it in the Instant Pot on a weeknight. 

- 3 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled and seeded- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 3 medium cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/2 golden delicious apple, peeled and cored- Pinch red pepper flakes
- 2 sprigs sage plus 8 sage leaves, divided- Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon white or yellow miso (if you have it)- 3 3/4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, divided- 1 medium yellow onion, minced
- 2 cups risotto rice, such as arborio
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter- Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for grating

Preheat oven to 400. Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4- inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread (continued on next page)
in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet. 

Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks. 

Transfer large squash mixture to a food processor and add miso and 1/4 cup broth. Blend until smooth. Season with salt. (At this point you can stop if you like; refrigerate everything to have available to finish assembling later.) 

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 4 minutes. 

Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated 
in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. 

Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure. Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize using steam-release valve (continued).
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium- high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel-lined plate. 

Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash pur√©e and brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce. 

Stir in a generous grating of Parmesan cheese, followed by the maple-roasted diced squash. Season with salt. Spoon risotto onto plates, top with fried sage leaves and more grated cheese, and serve. 

If anyone is wondering, Tyler is sad because he actually originally found this recipe and did all of the prep work for us ahead of time but he still doesn't get to have his name in the title because he didn't actually make it and he is not the author of this book. Ha ha!
