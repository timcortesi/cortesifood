So in addition to cooking all of the delicious things in this cookbook (and Book 1), there are a number of other delicious items you might not know about that you should buy directly from the grocery store. Especially from Trader Joes. Here is a random (incomplete) list of things I highly recommend you try. #ihearttraderjoes 

Random things to buy from Trader Joes: 

-Almond / Chocolate Croissants. In the freezer section. You take them out of the freezer the night before, let them proof/rise overnight, and then bake them in the morning. So good. Great for last minute guests. 
-Danish Kringle. These come in all different flavors depending on the season. I really like the almond one. Raspberry is pretty good too. 
-Soft & Juicy Dried Mango. Get the soft & juicy one, not the "Just mango slices one". 
-Greek honey yogurt. Tyler & the kids love this topped with whatever fruit/granola/etc we have on hand. 
-All the cheese. Literally, all of their cheeses are really good. Some of our favorites are Unexpected Cheddar, the Spanish Cheese Tapas Sampler, Creamy Toscano Cheese Soaked in Syrah, and the Sliced Smoked Gouda cheese. -Double Roasted Salsa. And whatever corn chips of your choosing. Really good. 
-Green Dragon Hot Sauce. Like Sriracha but even better. -Arrabiata Sauce. This is a somewhat spicy marinara sauce and it is so so good. 
-Tandoori Naan. In the freezer section. Heats up easily in the oven. One of the best naan breads I've found (from not an Indian restaurant). 
(continued on next page)
Random thin from Trader ntin : -Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese. Cheeeeese -Cocoa Drizzled Kettle Corn. They appear to carry this only in the winter time. So stock up then. 
-Speculoos Cookie Butter. Comes in a container that looks like peanut butter, but it is actually a sweet dessert spread made out of cookies. Tyler and the kids love it. 
-Mini Mint Ice Cream Mouthfuls. So. Good. 
-Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches. The most perfect Chipwich ice cream sandwich I have ever experienced in my life. These are amazing. 

Random things to buy from not Trader Joes: -Spindrift sparkling water. The Raspberry Lime flavor is 

my favorite. 
-Mallomars! These cookies are best eaten on the farm during harvest season. They are hard to come by the further away you go from New York City, and outside of "Mallomar season" (which is fall/winter-ish) so 1f you see them, stock up! 
-Chobani yogurt. I used to HATE yogurt when I was little, and I continued to greatly dislike it into adulthood, but I finally found one I like, and it is this one! Highly recommend the Greek yogurt fruit on the bottom varieties - blackberry, peach, black cherry, raspberry, and also the blended key lime is good too. 
-Talenti Sorbetto and Gelato. Sooooo good. They have many delicious flavors but two that are by far my favorite are the Roman Raspberry Sorbetto and the Caramel Cookie Crunch Gelato. I really wanted to like the Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip but it is too sugary and not at all raspberry-y, so don't bother with that one.
