These is how Lara makes cranberries for Thanksgiving. She usually makes them the night before. I really like them. 

- 1 1/2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup sweet red wine
- 1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries, rinsed- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 tablespoons orange zest, cut into slivers
- 1/2 cup dried cherries
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 1/2 cup orange juice

Combine sugar with red wine in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the fresh cranberries, cinnamon stick, orange peel, dried cherries and cranberries, and orange juice. Bring the mixture back to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often, for 10 to 15 minutes, until most of the cranberries have burst. 

Remove from heat and allow relish to cool slightly. Store in refrigerator.
