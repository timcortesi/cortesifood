This is another recipe that Mom recommends that you either make ahead of time and bring it along, or if you're feeling extra ambitious you can make it in a reflector oven while you are camping. Ask Mom about how to make a reflector oven, or you could probably find it on Google. #lmetfy

- 2 cups sliced strawberries
