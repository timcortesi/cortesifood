Pretty self explanatory, but this is the specific recipe from the magazine Mom bought from some grocery store aisle that we used to use while camping. 

- 3 (8”) flour tortillas
- 2 ounces (1/2 cup) shredded sharp Cheddar cheese- 2 slices bacon, crisply cooked, drained, crumbled- 3 tablespoon thinly sliced green onions
- 1 tablespoon margarine, melted

On half of each tortilla, sprinkle 1/3 or cheese, bacon and green onions. Fold other half over filling; press firmly with back of spatula. When ready to barbecue, brush one side of each folded tortilla with margarine; place filled tortillas, margarine side down, directly on grill, 4 to 6” from med coals. Cook 2 to 3 min or until crisp and brown. Brush top with melted margarine; turn. Cook 2 to 3 min or until crisp and brown. Cut each into 4 wedges. Serve with salsa, if desired.

**Becky Rant:**
As expected (on [page 173](Times_Union_Raita.md)), this movie is pretty bad. The wine is pretty decent though. Also I just kicked the cat off the counter. Cats are the worst.
