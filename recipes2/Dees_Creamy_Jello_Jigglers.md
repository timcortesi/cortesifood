Tyler's mom used to use this recipe to make jello eggs at Easter time when Tyler was growing up. You will need an egg mold if you want to make these as eggs. 

- 2 1/2 cups boiling water
- 4 small or 2 large boxes of jello
- 1 cup cold milk
- 1 small box instant vanilla pudding

Stir boiling water into mix from jello boxes until completely dissolved. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Pour cold milk into another bowl and add pudding mix. Whisk until well blended, 1-2 minutes. Quickly pour pudding mix into jello mix, stirring with whisk until well blended. Pour into a 9 x 13 pan and cool until set - about 3 hours. (Or use egg molds at Easter time, if you can find the molds.)

**Becky Rant:**
Now Will (John) Ferrell (did you look it up like I told you to on [page 213](Grandmothers_Angel_Food_Cake.md)? Told you so.) just dumped hot chocolate all over himself. And now they're doing a montage. Complete with peppy music. Also our cat (the other cat, not the one who was on the counter earlier) is sitting right in front of the tv. She is not the brightest. Also my contacts are getting really dry. At least the kids seem to have gone to sleep. Only 40 more pages of cookbook editing to go! Go Becky go!
