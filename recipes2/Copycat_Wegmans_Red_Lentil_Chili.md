I really love this lentil soup that Wegmans sells in their hot prepared soup/food bar section, but they also have this recipe on their website if you want to try making it yourself. I recommend reducing or eliminating altogether the tabasco sauce and cayenne pepper or else it will be too spicy (especially if you are making it to share with kids). You can always add more spicy stuff to your bowl at the end. Also I have never tried this, but the Wegmans website suggests that in addition to being a good soup it also makes a great sauce for tilapia. It also freezes well.

Bring lentils and 2 cups water to boil on high; turn off heat. Remove half the lentils and liquid; place in food processor or blender and puree, about 1 minute. 
Melt butter in stockpot on medium-low. Add onions; cook, stirring, about 2 minutes, until soft but not browned. Add celery and garlic; cook, stirring, 5 minutes, until soft but not browned. Add tomato; cook 5 minutes. 

Add stock, 2 cups water, tabasco, turmeric, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, and chili powder. Bring to simmer. 

Add reserved whole and pureed lentils plus liquid. Cook about 15 minutes, until lentils are tender. 

Combine cornstarch and remaining 2 tablespoons water in small bowl. Bring soup to boil; add cornstarch-water mixture. Stir 30 seconds to thicken slightly. Turn off heat; add green peppers. Season with salt.
