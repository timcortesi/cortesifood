I don't remember these at all, but Mom says we made them so I will put them in here and you can try them. 

- 1 cup butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 3 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Food coloring
- 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon peel, grated- 1 1/2 teaspoon lime peel, grated
- 1 1/2 teaspoon orange peel, grated- Colored sugar - yellow, green, and orange

Cream together butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Blend in flour & salt. Divide dough into 4 equal parts. To one add yellow coloring & lemon peel, to another green & lime, and to another orange (red & yellow) and orange peel. Leave the 4th dough portion plain. Chill all for 1 hour. 

Shape each colored dough portion into a roll 2" in diameter and 4" long. Divide plain dough into 3 equal parts. Roll each part into a rectangle 6 x 4" long. Wrap each rectangle around each roll of colored dough and press together firmly. Roll each in matching colored sugar. Wrap and chill at least 4 hours. 

Preheat oven to 400. Cut rolls into 1/8" slices and cut each slice in half. Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake for 6-8 minutes or until just set. Remove immediately from cookie sheet. Makes 10 dozen.
