In case you didn't get your bean soup fix on the last page. Here is another version. Bean soup is good for using up leftover ham from Easter or whatever. And for getting your kids (or Tim) to eat vegetables. Bean soup is especially good for eating right before a church service. 

- 1 pound dry great Northern beans- 8 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 ham hock
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 1/2 stalk celery, chopped
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cups chopped ham
- 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper

Rinse the beans, sorting out any broken or discolored ones. In a large pot over high heat, bring the water to a boil. Add the salt and beans and remove from heat. Let beans sit in the hot water for at least 60 minutes. After the 60 minutes of soaking, return the pot to high heat and place the ham bone, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, mustard and bay leaves in the pot. Stir well, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 60 more minutes. Remove ham bone and discard. Stir in the chopped ham and simmer for 30 more minutes. Season with ground white pepper to taste.
