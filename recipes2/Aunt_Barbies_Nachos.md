These are the nachos that Aunt Barbie always makes at Canoe Island Lodge. They go excellently with Uncle Jerry's strawberry daiquiris. That recipe is in Book 1. I'm not sure why this nachos recipe didn't make it in Book 1 as well. But anyway, here it is now. 

- 1 (16 oz.) bag tortilla chips
- 1 (16 oz.) can refried beans
- 1 (16 oz.) jar salsa
- 12 oz. shredded sharp cheddar cheese- 1 container (12 oz.) sour cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cover cookie sheet with aluminum foil (this is optional, but makes for easier cleanup). Spread the entire bag of chips on the cookie sheet, and make sure the corners of the chips are hanging over the edge of the sheet (so people can serve themselves). Spread teaspoonfuls of the refried beans around randomly on the chips, followed by teaspoonfuls of the salsa. Evenly spread the cheese overtop of the salsa. Bake until you can see the cheese starting to melt (approximately 10-12 minutes). Drop teaspoonfuls of the sour cream randomly overtop of the nachos and serve. 

Optionally, you can add jalapeno peppers, other (non sharp cheddar) cheese, etc.
