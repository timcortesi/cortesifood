This is (loosely) how Tyler makes his rotisserie chicken on the grill. Sometimes if he has time and is feeling extra fancy, he does extra steps first like brine the chicken or pack it in salt or some randomness like that. Sometimes he serves this over a salad, which is delicious. Eating this chicken motivated Henry to practice taking his first steps to learn how to walk. 

Whole chicken Canola oil Salt & pepper 

(Tyler didn't mention it but I assume there may be some work required to prep the chicken first - Remove any giblets you might receive? Truss it? Clean it and pat it dry? That kind of stuff.) 

Then rub it all over with canola oil, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Put it on the rotisserie thingie, and put that on the grill. Turn the middle burner off and leave the 2 side burners on medium or medium high. Roast for 45 minutes at 400 degrees.
