According to Aunt Wendy this is so easy that "it is not even really a recipe" but here it is anyway. Enjoy! Or visit her in California and I'm sure sure she would be happy to make it for you. 

Spaghetti squash, cut in half 
Oil (she uses avocado oil because California) 
Kosher salt and pepper to taste 
Fresh sprigs thyme 
1 pound ground turkey 
Marinara sauce (she always makes a big pot of the Wilkens spaghetti squash that is in Book 1) 

Preheat oven to 375. Scrape seeds out of squash. Brush lightly with oil and sprinkle with kosher salt & pepper. Put some of the thyme sprigs in each half. Put on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and bake for 45 minutes. 

While baking, brown turkey in a skillet. Add some marinara sauce. When squash is done, use a fork to loosen/scrape spaghetti squash - keep inside the squash. Scoop marinara meat sauce on top of squash, sprinkle with shredded Parmesan cheese. Bake for 10 more minutes.
