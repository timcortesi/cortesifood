Sadly unlike "To Grandmother's House Road Chicken" and "Hotdog in a Tailpipe" recipes later in this section, I can't claim that we never actually tried this one. You can thank Mom's friend Pam. 

Campfire Paper Bag Bacon 

Eggs 

Make campfire. Cook down to coals. Lay two strips of bacon in the bottom of a paper bag. Crack two eggs on top of the bacon. I know, this seems crazy, but just do it. Place the bag containing the bacon and eggs on the hot coals. I know, it makes no sense. Obviously, the bag will catch on fire and your entire breakfast will fall into the ashes. Because its a paper bag. Holding a bunch of greasy bacon. What did you think was going to happen? Try it a few more times just to be sure.
