I love this salad. It is both beautiful and delicious. If you don't feel like making the vinaigrette then don't. Just use whatever light vinaigrette dressing you might already have on hand.* This recipe is originally from Cooking Light except they also added olives but I hate those guys. 

- 2 large eggs
- 1 (8-oz.) package. haricots verts (French green beans)- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 (12-0z.) salmon fillet, about 1 in. thick
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided- 1 pound baby golden potatoes, quartered
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 head butter lettuce, torn (about 6 cups)
- 3/4 cup chopped English cucumber
- 1/2 cup fresh yellow corn kernels
- 4 small radishes, cut into 1/2-in. wedges

Bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil. Carefully add eggs to pan; cook 6 minutes. Add green beans; cook 2 minutes. Drain; plunge bean mixture into a bowl of ice water. Let stand 3 minutes; drain. Peel eggs, and cut into quarters. 

Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Sprinkle fish with (continued on next page)
1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Add fish, skin side down, to pan; cook 7 minutes. Turn, and cook 3 minutes. Remove fish from pan; break into large flakes with a fork. 

Place 1 tablespoon water and quartered potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave at high 4 minutes or until tender. Place potatoes on a paper towel-lined baking sheet; let potatoes dry for 5 minutes. 

Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add potatoes; cook 3 minutes or until browned and crisp. Combine potato mixture, garlic, parley, dill, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. 

Combine remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons oil, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper, vinegar, parsley, and mustard in a bowl. Mix well. 

Divide lettuce among 4 plates; top evenly with eggs, potatoes, beans, cucumber, corn, radishes, and fish. (Google "Cooking Light Summer Salmon Nicoise Salad" and you will see some beautiful plating ideas.) Drizzle with vinaigrette. 

*The Light Champagne Vinagrette from Trader Joe's is 

very good and would work well for this dish. #becausemoretraderjoes #obviously
