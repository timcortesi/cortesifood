Sadly this is not really a recipe because I don't know what the actual recipe is, but there is a restaurant near my house called J. Gilbert's that serves a fabulous appetizer called "Smoked Salmon Rillette" and this is what the menu says the ingredients are. They serve it in a cute little mason jar on a slate board with some toasted baguette slices and it is one of my favorites. 

Spread ingredients: House smoked-salmon Dill 
Chive 
Red onion 
Capers 
Egg (hard boiled) Mustard 

Serve with: Crostini (toasted bread) Cornichons (tiny pickles) 

Mix spread ingredients together in unknown but delicious ratio, and serve with the bread and cornichons. Or visit Becky & Tyler and we'll take you out to experience the real thing.
