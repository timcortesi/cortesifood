This is Tyler's Gram's recipe to make copy-cat peanut butter chocolate Tasty Kake Tandy Kakes. Tasty Kakes originated in the Philadelphia area and there are various versions of them sold in gas stations like Sheetz and you can now even find them in various grocery stores, Target, etc. This version is Tyler's favorite. It is essentially a white cake topped with peanut butter and then with melted chocolate.

- 2 cups sugar
- 1 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 cups flour
- 1/4 cup salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
