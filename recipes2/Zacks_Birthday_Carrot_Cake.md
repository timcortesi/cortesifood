This is a recipe that Rachel invented (by modifying a different recipe) for Tim's friend Zack before their cruise. Supposedly it was "the best carrot cake ever". 

- Carrot Cake:
- 4 eggs
- 3/4 cup canola or vegetable oil- 1/2 cup applesauce
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons baking powder- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 cup (8 ounces) crushed pineapple, well drained- 3 cups shredded carrots
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

- Cream Cheese Frosting:
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

(instructions on next page)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease either a 9 x 13" pan or two 9" round pans. In a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, applesauce, white & brown sugars & vanilla. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in pineapple & carrots. Fold in walnuts. Pour into prepared pan(s). 

Bake in the preheated oven for 40-50 min (for 9 x 13 pan) or 35-40 min (for 2 9" round pans), or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 15 min., then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. 

Cream Cheese Frosting: 
In a medium bowl, combine butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stir in chopped walnuts. Frost the cooled cake. 

Serves 10-12.
