This is a quick and easy way to make meatballs in a tomato sauce in the Instant Pot. Great for getting dinner on the table on a busy weeknight. But don't ever sneeze. 

- A few cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/2 small onion, diced
- 1 28 ounce can San Marzano tomatoes (whole or- diced; we usually use whole)
- Herbs of your choosing (oregano, rosemary, etc)
- Whatever ingredients you prefer to make meatballs- (Tyler does this using about 1 pound ground beef- plus some breadcrumbs and cheese)
- Cooked pasta for serving

Assemble raw meatballs. Saute onion and garlic using the "saute" mode of the Instant Pot. Add canned tomatoes including liquid. Gently crush the whole tomatoes if using those. Nestle the raw meatballs on top of the tomatoes. Lock the Instant Pot and cook for 10 minutes on low pressure. Use slow release. Serve over cooked pasta. (Spaghetti. All covered with cheese. Hold onto your meatball. And don't ever sneeze. Get it?) 

Sadly this is the end of the Instant Pot section. If you have your own Instant Pot and recipes you like, please send them to me!! Tyler and I are always looking for new ones to try.
