This is a recipe Rachel got from Hello Fresh. She says it is "one of the best things she has ever eaten". The recipe on Hello Fresh's website does not actually have all of the quantities so we kind of modified this when we made it when she and Mom were visiting. You can experiment. 

- 1 zucchini, cut into 1/2" cups
- 4 ounces heirloom grape tomatoes, halved- 1/4 ounce thyme, leaves removed from stems- 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 can chickpeas
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- 3/4 cup Israeli couscous
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable stock
- 1/2 cup feta cheese
- 1 lemon

Preheat oven to 425. Toss zucchini, tomatoes, and half the thyme (leaves) on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. On another baking sheet, toss chickpeas, paprika, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast both sheets in oven until crisp, about 20 minutes, tossing halfway through. 

Heat butter, garlic, and scallion whites in a medium pot over medium high heat. Once butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, add couscous and remaining thyme.

Stir to coat, season with salt and pepper, and cook until couscous is lightly toasted, 2-3 minutes. 

Stir stock into pot. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and reduce to a simmer. Cook until couscous is al dente, 10-12 minutes. Add half the veggies, half the feta, and a squeeze of lemon to pot with couscous and toss to combine. 
Season with salt and pepper. Divide couscous mixture between plates, then top with remaining veggies and chickpeas. Sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining feta cheese. 

Serves 2.

**Becky Rant:**
You will be happy to hear that I have managed since [page 79](Stone_Soup.md) to get all of the laundry back in the basket. And the baby is now chewing on a rubber duck while she empties the Duplo (Duplos? Is that word supposed to have an S?) container. Adelyn is doing some beautiful coloring. I am yawning. Because I haven't gotten more than about 4 hours of sleep per night for the past several nights since the baby has been sick. Poor baby. And poor mommy. But onward with the cookbook editing! Because we must finish Book 2 in time to order for Christmas!!
