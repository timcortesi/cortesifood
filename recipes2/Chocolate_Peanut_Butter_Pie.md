This pie is about 9000 calories but it is delicious. When I made it I didn't have Oreos in my house (I KNOW!) but I did have chocolate graham crackers so 1 think I used those instead following some instructions I found on google to make and bake a graham cracker crust which I then filled with the rest of the ingredients after it cooled. 

- 1 (14.3 0z) package whole Oreos (about 36 Oreos)
- 1 cup (16 tablespoons) softened butter, divided
- 1 1/2 cups + 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter, divided- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 cup chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Finely crush the Oreos with a food processor, blender, or in a Ziploc bag. Stir crumbs together with 8 tablespoons 
melted butter until well combined. Press into the bottom 
and sides of a pie pan. Freeze crust for 10 minutes. 

Add the remaining 8 tablespoons of butter, 1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter, and 1 cup powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on low until smooth and creamy. Spoon the peanut butter mixture over the crust into a smooth layer. Place back in freezer. 

Place chocolate chips and remaining 2 tablespoons of peanut butter in a large heat-proof bowl. In a saucepan, bring cream to a rolling simmer over medium-high heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate chips and peanut butter and let sit for 5 minutes, then whisk until completely smooth. Pour the chocolate layer over the peanut butter layer. Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour before serving.
