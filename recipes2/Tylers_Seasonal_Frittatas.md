Tyler sometimes makes frittatas on weekend mornings with random whatever leftovers we happen to have in the fridge, or weeknight evenings when we need something quick and easy and still healthy to eat. The summer version below is loosely based on a recipe from America's Test Kitchen, and the fall version is from the very last Cooking Light issue. (Unrelated: I am so sad the Cooking Light is going away!!) You make whatever seasonal versions you like with whatever ingredients you have. Henry does not like when Tyler makes frittatas because EGG and CHEESE. Adelyn likes the EGG and CHEESE but not the vegetables. Serve with a side of fruit, or a lightly dressed arugula salad topped with some sliced strawberries, or something like that. 

- Summer:
- 6-8 eggs, lightly beaten
- About 1/2 cup shredded cheese (like mozzarella, fontina,- swiss, parmesan, whatever Italian-ish cheese you have)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- A handful of leftover roasted or grilled vegetables - think- yellow squash, zucchini, tomatoes, onions
- At handful of leftover crumbled or chopped italian sausage- ham, or steak (already cooked)

Preheat the oven to 350. Combine the eggs, cheese, salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 10" nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables and meat and warm gently. Add the egg mixture and stir gently until the eggs on the bottom are (continued on next page)
set and firm, about 30 seconds. Gently pull the cooked eggs back from one edge of the skillet and tilt the pan, allowing any uncooked eggs to run to the cleared edge of the skillet. Repeat this process, working your way around the skillet, until the egg on top is mostly set but still moist, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the frittata top is set and dry to the touch, about 3 minutes. Run a spatula around the skillet edge to loosen the frittata and invert it onto a serving plate. Top with grated parmesan and serve warm, room temperature, or chilled. Serves 4. 

- Fall:
- 2 cups chopped peeled sweet potato
- Cooking spray
- 5 Canadian bacon slices, chopped
- 2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- 1 cup thinly sliced shallots
- 6 large eggs
- 1 ounce gruyere cheese, shredded (about 1/4 cup)- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 ounce goat cheese, crumbled (about 1/4 cup)- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Preheat broiler to high with oven rack in top position. Place sweet potato in a microwavable bowl; add water to a depth of 1/2 inch. Cover with a plate and microwave until slightly tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain sweet potato, and transfer to a plate. Pat sweet potato dry, and lightly coat with cooking spray.
Heat a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add Canadian bacon and 1 tablespoon oil; cook, stirring often, until bacon is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving drippings in skillet. Add shallots and sweet potato to skillet; cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 

Whisk together eggs, Gruy√©re, sage, pepper, and salt in a bowl. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to sweet potato mixture in skillet; pour egg mixture into skillet. Cook over medium, gently pulling eggs in from sides of skillet with a spatula, until eggs are partially set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with goat cheese and reserved bacon. 

Transfer skillet to oven; broil until eggs are completely set and toppings are golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle with chives.

**Becky Rant:**
Once upon a time there was a baby who was supposed to be napping while I did the final editing of this book. But is she sleeping?? No. She is screaming her head off. She is tired, but doesn't prefer to be asleep right now. Because why take a nap when you could be screaming? WHY DON'T MY KIDS SLEEP WHEN THEY'RE TIRED?? 
At least this nap has not (yet) resulted in a trip to the emergency room like a certain other dear daughter's recent nap did coughAdelyncough....
