There is also a recipe for potato salad in Book 1 (see [page 105](Henrys_Favorite_Fish_Tacos.md)), but I like this one even better. It is the closest I have been able to get to an actual recipe to replicate "Rob The Pig Guy's Potato Salad" (see previous page). Possibly I just like having hard boiled eggs in my potato salad. 

- 3 pounds red potatoes (10 medium), scrubbed and cut- into 3/4 inch chunks
- 1/2 cup red wine vinegar
- Salt and pepper
- 3/4 cup mayo
- 1/2 cup minced sweet pickles
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 ribs celery, chopped fine
- 4 hard boiled eggs, peeled and chopped coarse
- 3 tablespoons minced red onion
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

Bring the potatoes and 4 quarts water to a simmer in a large pot and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Gently toss the warm potatoes with the vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise, pickles, and mustard together. Toss the chilled potatoes with the mayo mixture, celery, eggs, onions, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serves 6-8.
