I don't know anything about this recipe other than it is from Mom. So you can ask her about it. I would ask her myself but the writing of this cookbook is a big secret surprise!! Except Henry might have given it away while we were on the farm Thanksgiving weekend. But it was SUPPOSED to be a surprise. So I can't ask her. Also now I want a danish. Also kids are the worst at keeping secrets. 

- 1 8-count tube refrigerated crescent rolls- 6 tablespoons cream cheese- 6 tablespoon fruit jam

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Unroll dough. Divide along dotted lines into 4 equal rectangles. Working with 1 rectangle at a time, gently pinch and smooth the dough to eliminate the diagonal dotted lines. Trim dough along 1 side to form a square. Combine scraps to make 6 squares total. 

Place 1 tablespoon cream cheese and 1 tablespoon jam in the center of each square. Fold each corer to the center of the square, pinching them together to make little pouches. Transfer to a greased baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, approx 13 min. Sprinkle with confectionerâ€™s sugar. Serve warm. 

Makes 6 danishes.
