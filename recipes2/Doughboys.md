Very good for breakfast. You can use whatever kind of jelly you want (grape, raspberry, strawberry, currant, etc), but use jelly instead of jam because otherwise the seeds / chunks of fruit get stuck in the jelly squirt bottle. 

1 tube refrigerator biscuits (8-10/package) Whatever kind of jelly you want Confectioners sugar 

Prepare jellies ahead of time by spooning each jelly into a separate, small, condiment squeeze container that has a long, pointy nozzle. Put confectioner’s sugar in a shaker jar. 

When ready to cook, separate a biscuit from the tube of refrigerated biscuits, and stretch/elongate it to be 6-8” long. Starting at the end of a clean stick, wrap dough diagonally down the stick, overlapping edges as you go until about 4-6” of stick is covered. Slowly toast dough over campfire until golden brown on the outside, and thoroughly cooked on the inside. Carefully remove doughboy from stick, and squirt jelly into 1 end. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar if desired. 8-10 servings.
