This is how Tyler makes "fig and pig" pizza (it's funny because it rhymes) on the grill. The "pig" is leftover pork that he smoked. I do the rolling out of the dough because Tyler sucks at it. #fig #andpig 

- 1 bag refrigerated pizza dough (we get this from- Trader Joes)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1-2 sweet onions, halved and cut into thin half-rings
- White sugar, salt & pepper to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Leftover smoked pork, shredded
- Fresh figs, quartered
- Assorted cheeses (fresh mozzarella circles, gouda,- fontina, whatever you feel like
- Arugula
- Balsamic vinegar

Preheat gas grill on high, making sure grates are clean. After about 10-15 minutes, reduce to medium high and turn down or off middle burner. Keep grill 400-450 degrees. 

Follow dough's instructions regarding rising. Ask your wife to shape the dough into two thin ovals on lightly 

greased parchment paper. 

Meanwhile, heat butter in cast iron pan and heat on medium until melted and a little frothy.

Add onions and cook, stirring often to caramelize. When onions start to soften, season with sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. 

Brush olive oil on top of dough and place on grill, oiled side down. Cook for about 5 minutes until dough is cooked enough to flip. Flip it. 

Top with cheeses, caramelized onion, shredded pork, and figs. Cook another 5-10 minutes until cheese is bubbly and crust is crispy. 

Remove from grill, cover with arugula and drizzle with balsamic vinegar and cracked pepper. Cut until squares or triangles and serve.

I know, I know. Get out of here with all of these recipes and just tell us what the kids are doing! You haven't given us an update since [page 98](ChickpeaPowered_Mediterranean_Couscous.md)! What trouble are they getting into now?? Well, actually, we had to take a break to go pick Henry up from school. These days picking Henry up consists of getting the girls all bundled up, with Elizabeth in the stroller, and Adelyn running as fast as she possibly can while Elizabeth giggles and giggles at Adelyn, until we meet up with Henry walking home.
