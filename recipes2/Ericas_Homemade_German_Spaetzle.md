Erica is a spaetzle making pro. The first year she tried this she was lacking in the spaetzle making equipment department, but was so dedicated that she hand piped the spaetzle noodles into the pot. After that we purchased for her the best spaetzle maker money could buy (which was definitely not just the cheapest - but still highly reviewed! one on Amazon). Erica highly recommends obtaining your own spaetzle maker if you plan to undertake spaetzle making yourself. 

- 4 eggs
- 1/3 cup milk
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

Whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt in a medium bowl. Add in the flour and stir until well combined. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Place your spaetzle maker over the top, then pour half of the batter into the cup of the device. Quickly slide the cup back and forth to allow the batter to drop through. Repeat with the second half of the batter, working quickly, until all the batter is cooking in the pot. 

Set the spaetzle maker aside and give the dumplings a good stir in the pot. Let them cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until floating on the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a large bowl. Toss with butter and spices. Serve warm.
