Here is a ridiculous "car cooking" recipe that we never actually made. But just in case you're feeling adventurous... 

- 2 ounces prosciutto, diced
- 1/2 cup shredded provolone
- 3 scallions, minced
- 1 chicken breast, boned and butterflied- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil

At home, mix together prosciutto, provolone, and scallions. Place half of the chicken breast smooth side down, then spread prosciutto mixture over it. Season with salt and pepper. Fold other half of breast over and press together gently. Place on heavy duty foil that has been brushed with olive oil. Wrap. Place on manifold of car and drive. Turn once during cooking. Takes about 2 to 2 1/2 hours (about 140 miles driving time).
