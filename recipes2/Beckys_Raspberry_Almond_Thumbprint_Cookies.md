This is a recipe that I found originally on Sally's Baking Addiction the Christmas before Elizabeth was born, when I passed time waiting for the baby to arrive (LATE) by mixing up and baking a gazillion different kinds of Christmas cookies. Anyway, these are great if you like raspberry jam (who doesn't). 

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, divided
- 2 cups + 2 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 cup raspberry jam
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1-2 tablespoons cream or milk

Beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute, using a stand mixture on medium speed. Switch mixer to medium speed and add the sugar, vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Turn the mixer off and pour in the flour. Turn mixer on low and slowly beat until a very soft dough is formed. Scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Press the dough down to compact it and tightly cover with saran wrap to chill until firm, at least 4 hours. 

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (silicone mats 

preferred to reduce spreading).
Shape the cookie dough into balls about using about 1 tablespoon of dough per ball. If you find that the balls of dough are sticky and/or have gotten a little soft after rolling- place the balls of dough back into the refrigerator to firm up. You absolutely DO NOT want soft dough. 

Make an indentation with your thumb into each ball. The dough may crack slightly when you press your thumb into it. Smooth it out with your fingers if you can. Fill each with about a 1/2 teaspoon of jam. 

Bake the cookies for 13-14 minutes, or until very lightly browned on the edges. The cookies will puff up and spread slightly. Do not overbake. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before glazing. 

Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, cream/milk, and remaining 1 teaspoon of almond extract together until smooth. Add more liquid to thin out or add more confectioners’ sugar to thicken to your desired consistency. Drizzle over cooled cookies. Glaze will set within a couple hours. 

Makes about 26 cookies, so you may want to double this recipe.
