This recipe is really cool because the graham cracker squares absorb a bunch of moisture and turn from crackers into a "cake" texture. 

- 2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant sugar free French- vanilla pudding mix
- 1 (8 ounce) container (fat free?) frozen whipped- topping, thawed
- 3 cups milk
- 1 (16 ounce) package graham cracker squares
- 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the pudding mix, whipped topping, and milk. Arrange a single layer of graham cracker squares in the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking pan. Evenly spread half of the pudding mixture over the crackers. Top with another layer of crackers and the remaining pudding mixture. Top with a final layer of graham crackers. 

Heat whipping cream Just to a boil, then pour over chocolate chips. Stir until smooth. Pour ganache over the whole cake up to the edges of the pan. Cover and chill overnight.
