These cookies include some special ingredients (brewer's yeast and flaxseed meal) that are supposed to help increase increase milk supply while breastfeeding. They also taste really good and your husband and kids will likely eat half of them even though they are clearly not breastfeeding. Make these as a gift for your favorite busy nursing mom (hint hint!) This recipe is from simplisticallyliving.com. #forlactatingmoms #orjustfornormalpeople #notthatlactatingmomsarentnormalbecausewetotallyrock 

- 4 tablespoons water or milk
- 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
- 1 cup butter
- 1 cup white granulated sugar
- 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 eggs
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons brewer’s yeast (do not substitute)- 3 cups slow rolled oats
- 2 cups dark chocolate chips
- 3 tablespoons peanut butter

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Mix the water or milk with the flaxseed meal in a small bow] and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. In the meantime, combine the butter, white granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, and the eggs ina bowl and beat with a mixer (continued on next page)
for 2-3 minutes until all ingredients are well mixed. Add the flaxseed to the mixture until well blended and set aside. 

In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and brewer’s yeast. You can use a spatula to mix the ingredients together. Combine this mixture to the butter mixture which takes another 1-2 minutes. Stir the oats, chocolate chips, and the peanut butter into the mixture until well blended. 

Using a tablespoon scoop out mixture, form into balls, and place onto a lightly greased cookie sheet.* Make sure to space them about 2 inches apart. 

Bake for 10-13 minutes depending on your oven. Mine were baked for exactly 13 minutes then I allowed them to cool on the pan for another 3-4 minutes and they were baked perfectly. 

*If you don't think you will eat all the cookies right away, you can freeze them on the cookie sheet after they are rolled into balls. Once frozen, store all the frozen (uncooked) balls in a freezer bag in your freezer. When you are ready to eat them you can cook them from frozen as above, but maybe add an extra 1-2 minutes of baking time.
