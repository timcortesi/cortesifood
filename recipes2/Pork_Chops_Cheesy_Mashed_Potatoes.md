This recipe is originally from Blue Apron. It is very easy to make and tastes good too. It is served with a side of roasted broccoli. Adelyn frequently tells us that she "doesn't like green", but she does love broccoli. Odd. 

- 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 1/4 pounds red potatoes, cut into ~1" pieces- 2 ounces cheddar cheese curds, chopped- 3/4 cup milk, divided
- 4 boneless, center-cut pork chops
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 bunch sage leaves, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Preheat oven to 450. Toss the broccoli with 2 teaspoons olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Roast the broccoli until browned and tender, about 20-22 minutes, in a single layer spread on a sheet pan on the middle oven rack. 

Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling. Add the potatoes and cook 16-18 minutes until tender. Drain and return to pot. Add cheese, drizzle of olive oil, and half of the milk. Mash to desired consistency. 

Pat the pork dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium heat until hot. Add the pork; cook 4-6 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. (continued on next page)
Leaving any browned bits in the pan, transfer pork to a cutting board. Let rest at least 5 minutes. 

While the pork rests, add the butter, maple syrup, sage, vinegar, and remaining milk to the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium high, stirring frequently and scraping up any browned bits, 2-3 minutes, or until thickened. Turn off the heat. 

Slice the rested pork crosswise. Serve with the roasted broccoli and cheesy mashed potatoes. Top the pork with 

the pan sauce.
