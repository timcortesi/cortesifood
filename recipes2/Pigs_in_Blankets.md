An excellent choice for a pre-dinner appetizer at Canoe Island Lodge. Because 4 courses are just not enough. 
Also because hot dogs are yum. But not if you think about them. Don't think about them. Just make the recipe. #hotdogs #sogood #alsokindagross 

- 1 package (~14 oz) cocktail sausages
- (Cocktail Smokies are best)- 1 tube refrigerated crescent rolls- Spicy brown mustard- â€œYou will actually need about 6 packages of cocktail- sausages and 6 tubes of crescent rolls if you are actually- making these at Canoe Island Lodge.

Unroll the crescent roll dough and cut into small isosceles triangles. Wrap each triangle around a sausage and place seam side down on a greased cookie sheet. Bake in 375 degree oven for 11-13 minutes. Serve with bowl of mustard for dipping.

But what has the baby been up to since [page 45](Vegetable_Dip_in_a_Bread_Bowl.md), you may ask? Oh, just eating my shirt. And grabbing the computer with her gooey fingers. Which she also keeps trying to stick in my mouth. While she laughs maniacally. Also from time to time she announces she is ALL DONE. Because she definitely thinks she is done with nap. I'm pretending not to understand.
