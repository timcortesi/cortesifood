This is how I make stuffed zucchini in the late summer when the zucchini plants are growing like crazy and we have a ton of zucchini. Make sure you pick the zucchini before they get huge or turn into zumpkins. Serves 8. 

- 4 medium zucchini, cut in half lengthwise
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed- 8 ounces hot Italian sausage, casings removed
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 medium vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

- 1/2 cup parmesan, finely grated
- 1/2 cup mozzarella, shaved
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 400. Use a spoon to scoop the flesh out of the zucchini. Place the zucchini "boats" in a 9x13" casserole dish. Chop the zucchini flesh and set aside. 

Heat olive oil a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook for 4 minutes. Add the garlic, onion, chopped zucchini flesh, tomatoes and some salt and pepper. Cook until softened, about 4 minutes. 

Meanwhile, mix the cheeses, breadcrumbs and parsley. Spoon in and mound the sausage mixture into the zucchini boats. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over top. Place in oven and bake until golden on top, 20 minutes.
