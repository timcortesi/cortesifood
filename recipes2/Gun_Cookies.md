Mom calls these Spritz cookies. But that's not what they are called because they are called Gun cookies. The best part about making gun cookies is yelling "HURRY HURRY HURRY GET OUT OF THE WAY GET ANOTHER COOKIE SHEET MOVE MOVE MOVE as the dough never stops coming out of the cookie gun. Ah, fond family bonding memories. Now Mom will say "REBECCA LYNN! WE DO NOT WRITE THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE FAMILY COOKBOOK!!!" 

- 1 cup margarine
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 2 1/4 cup sifted flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

With mixer at medium speed, cream margarine until soft. Add sugar gradually, continuing to cream until light and fluffy. Add egg, lemon extract; beat well. Sift flour, salt, baking powder together; add in 3 additions; beat well after each addition. Shape dough into 2 balls; wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 1 hour. Fill cookie gun; make into desired shapes on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 7-9 min at 400 degrees or until light golden, being careful not to overbake. 

Makes 6-7 dozen.
