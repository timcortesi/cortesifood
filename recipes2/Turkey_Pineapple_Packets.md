I don't remember making this but Mom has it in the list of camping recipes so you can ask her about it. 

- Packets
- 1 (1 pound) package boneless turkey breast slices/cutlets
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen medley long grain white rice- with peas & mushrooms, thawed
- 1 (8 ounce) can pineapple slices in its own juice (drain- and reserve liquid for use in marinade)
- 4 red bell pepper rings, 1/4” thick
- 4 green bell pepper rings, 1/4” thick

- Marinade
- Reserved pineapple liquid + enough water to make 1/2 cup- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar

In large resealable plastic bag, combine all marinade ingredients; blend well. Place turkey breast slices in marinade; turn to coat. Refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes, turning once. Cut 4 (12x18”) pieces heavy-duty foil. Open packages of rice mixture; stir to distribute sauce. Spoon half of each package onto center of each piece of foil. Drain turkey, reserving marinade. Place turkey breast slices over rice. Top turkey in each packet with 1 pineapple slice, red bell pepper ring and green bell pepper ring, overlapping slightly. Wrap securely, using double- fold seals. When ready to barbecue, place packets on grill, 4-6” from med-high coals. Cook 20 to 25 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink, turning once. Heat marinade to a boil. Serve over turkey and rice. Serves 4.
