I found this recipe (on onceamonthmeals.com) when I was looking for a breakfast recipe that used apples after a trip to the farm. I liked it enough that I saved it and now here itis! #apples #bacon #yum #oinkoink 

- 1-2 cups peeled and diced apples
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup, divided- 1 1/2 cups Bisquick
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 3/4 cups cook and diced bacon

Preheat oven to 375. Grease 8x8 pan. 

In a bowl, toss together diced apple and 2 tablespoons maple syrup. Spread apples evenly in the bottom of prepared pans. 

In the bowl, whisk together pancake mix, milk, eggs, and remaining 1 tablespoon maple syrup until smooth. Pour pancake mixture over apples. Sprinkle cheese and bacon evenly over the pancake mixture. 

Bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes until cooked through and lightly browned. Serve immediately, or you can let this cool and wrap it tightly (in saran wrap/foil) and freeze it to heat up/eat later.
