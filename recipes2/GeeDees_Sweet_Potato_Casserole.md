This is the way Dee makes sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. I don't usually like sweet potatoes, but I do like this. Possibly it is all the added butter and sugar - yum. Dee also doubles the topping amounts listed below in order to cover the potatoes well. 

- 3-4 sweet potatoes
- 3 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla- Dash of salt
- 1/4 cup melted butter- 1 cup white sugar- 1/2 cup milk

- Topping ingredients:- 1/2 cup chopped pecans- 1/8 cup flour
- 1/2 cup brown sugar- 1/4 cup butter, softened

Boil sweet potatoes until soft, then peel. Preheat oven to 350. Place in a bowl with remaining casserole ingredients, and whip with a beater. Pour into a greased 9x13 pan. 

Combine topping ingredients; double the quantities above if you want to make this like how Dee makes hers (i.e. extra delicious). Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
