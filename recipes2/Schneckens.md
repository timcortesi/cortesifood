Grandmother used to make these for us for special breakfasts. She let the dough rise on the radiator (if no one was sitting on it). Mom lets the dough rise in the sun in her bedroom. I use the oven (more on how to do this in the Minka's Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls recipe which is right after this one). #radiator #hotbuttsarethebestbutts 

- Dough:
- 1 package yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 3/4 cup milk (warm)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup soft shortening
- 3 1/4-4 cups flour
- Filling:
- 4 tablespoons margarine, softened, divided- 1/2 cup sugar
- 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon- 1 cup raisins, divided- Butterscotch-Pecan Topping:
- 1 cup margarine or butter
- 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar- 48 pecan halves
Place in greased bowl and turn greased side up. 
Cover with damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until double, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if an indentation remains when touched). Punch dough down with floured fist and divide in half. 

Before rolling dough into rectangles, heat margarine or butter until melted; stir in brown sugar. Spray Pam in each of 24 muffin tin cups or in 9x13 or 9x9 pan, and distribute melted mixture. Position 24 pairs of 2 pecan halves, upside down in each cup (or in rows - 3 across by 5 down, and 3 by 3, in respective pans). 

Roll half dough into rectangle, 15x9 inches, on lightly floured surface. Spread with half of the margarine. Mix sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle half over rectangle. Sprinkle half of the raisins on top. Roll up tightly, beginning at long side. Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal well and stretch roll to make even. With scissors, cut roll in half, and then each half in half, and then each section into thirds, yielding 12 individual rolls. Turn each roll in its side and center over each pair of pecan halves. 

Repeat with remaining half of dough. Cover pans with a damp cloth. Let rise until double, about 40 minutes. 

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake until golden brown, 25-30 minutes. Immediately invert pan onto foil-lined cookie sheet. Let pan remain a minute so butterscotch can drizzle 

over rolls. 

Makes 24.
