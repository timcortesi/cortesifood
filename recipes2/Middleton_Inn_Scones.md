Tyler and I stayed at the Middleton Inn in Washington, Virginia for our one year wedding anniversary, and when we did we had these scones, and when we had them they were made with dried cherries. They were some of the best scones I have ever had (except of course Rachel's on the next page). We loved them so much that we asked for the recipe. In other news, this year we will celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary! I can't believe it has already been that long. Go team! 

- 4 cups King Arthur all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon each - baking powder, baking soda, salt
- 2.5 ounces dried fruit (cherries, cranberries,- blueberries, ginger, etc)
- 1.5 sticks frozen unsalted butter
- 1/2 quart + 1/8 cup heavy cream

Mix dry ingredients. Add butter and cream. Combine until dough begins to come together. Roll out dough into 1/2" and cut to desired shape. Place on wax paper lined sheet pans and freeze. Store scones in ziploc bags in freezer until ready to use. 

To bake: Preheat oven to 375. Place frozen scones on baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, rotating pan after 10 

minutes.
