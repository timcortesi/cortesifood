For years after I wrote Book #1, every time Mom would email me about Book #2, she would always include in the list of recipes she wanted me to include in this book "Aunt Barbie's Cream Cheese Brownies". I asked the Pratts for the recipe, but Stephanie tells me she doesn't think they have an actual recipe and thinks they just use whatever it says on the box. Sooooo give that a try. If it doesn't taste right call Stephanie.
