These are some of the Christmas cookies that the Pratt family makes that I LOVE. They are so good. The recipe makes 4 dozen cookies. If you double it you can make an extra batch for meeee!! 

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 1/4 cup butter (at room temperature), divided- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
- 4—1'% oz Peppermint Patties (plus extra for eating)- 3 tbsp crushed red & white peppermint candies- 1/4 cup butter
- 2 oz unsweetened chocolate (finely chopped)- 1/4 cup half & half
- 2 cups sifted powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 375F. Line several cookie sheets with parchment paper; set aside. 

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the sugars and 1 cup butter until light & fluffy. Add vanilla & eggs; beat well. Gradually add flour mixture until combined.

Chill dough for at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, cut small pieces from each Peppermint Patty to make it square. Slice the square patty into 12 equal rectangles. Eat the edges. Eat a few extra Patties too. 

Roll 1 tablespoon of cookie dough to form a ball, and flatten it slightly. Place a rectangle of Peppermint Patty in the center and shape the dough around it, enclosing it completely. Re-roll into a ball and place the cookies 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 7 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. 

In a medium bowl, combine % cup butter, chocolate and half & half. Microwave on medium power for 1 minute, until melted. Gently stir mixture, then add powdered sugar. This will be the chocolate glaze. Eat a couple extra Peppermint Patties. 

Spoon 11 teaspoon glaze on top of each cookie, then spread with the back of the teaspoon to make a 
circle approximately 1” in diameter. Sprinkle immediately with crushed peppermint candies. Eat at least 17 cookies right away. Store any extras (ha) in in an airtight container. 

Makes 4 dozen cookies.
