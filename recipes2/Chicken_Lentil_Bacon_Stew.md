This is a recipe Tyler originally found while looking for Instant Pot recipes on seriouseats.com and then modified to do things like add extra carrots and tomatoes. Cooking in the Instant Pot is Tyler's preferred way of cooking lately. I have no idea what a "lardon" is. Google seems to think it is a fancy way to cut up bacon. What is wrong with the regular way of dicing it? I have no idea. You can ask Tyler "I'm too fancy for regular dicing" Kramer. 

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
- 8 ounces slab bacon or pancetta, cup into 1/2" lardons
- 1 medium onion, diced (about 1 cup)
- 4 medium carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
- 8 ounces dried French lentils, such as Le Puy
- 12 sprigs parsley, leaves roughly chopped, stems tied- together with a piece of kitchen twine
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (a mix- of thighs and drumsticks for best texture, though- breasts will work as well)
- 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, drained
- 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, plus more to taste

Heat oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bacon and cook until starting to crisp around edges, about 1 minute. Add onions and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes longer. Add carrots, lentils, parsley stems, bay leaves, chicken legs, and chicken stock.

Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure. Cook for 20 minutes. Cool pressure cooker under a cold running tap (or if using an electric cooker, use the quick release valve), and open. Using tongs, transfer chicken pieces to a bowl. Discard parsley stems. Add tomatoes. Return lentils to high heat and continue cooking, stirring, until reduced to a thick, stew-like consistency, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, shred chicken, discarding bones and skin. 

Stir chicken and vinegar into beans. Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir in half of chopped parsley, and serve, passing remaining parsley, sherry vinegar, and olive oil at the table. 

Serves 4.
