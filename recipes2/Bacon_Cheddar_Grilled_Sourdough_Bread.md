Mmm... bacon and cheese. Delicious. My contacts are really dry from staring at this computer screen. 

- 1 (1 pound) loaf sourdough bread
- 3 tablespoon margarine, softened
- 6 ounce (1 1/2 cups) shredded sharp Cheddar cheese- 4 slices bacon, crisply cooked, drained and crumbled- 2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, if desired

Heat grill. Cut loaf into 1” slices. Lightly spread one side of each slice of bread wit margarine. Place, margarine side down, on ungreased surface or cookie sheet. Sprinkle cheese, bacon and parsley evenly on bread slices. When ready to barbecue, place slices, margarine side down, directly on grill 4-6” from med high coals. Cook 4 to 6 min or until bottom of bread is toasted and cheese is melted. Serves 8.
