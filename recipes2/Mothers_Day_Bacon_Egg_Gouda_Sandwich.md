Tyler and the kids make this for me for Mother's Day breakfast in bed because I love it and they are awesome. It is a copycat version of a breakfast sandwich from Starbucks. 

Bacon 
Eggs 
Ciabatta rolls 
Butter 
Sliced smoked gouda cheese (we get this from Trader Joes - it comes pre-sliced and is great) 

Cook the bacon. Scramble the eggs (but try to leave them in large chunks so the sandwich doesn't fall apart). Cut the ciabatta rolls in half and lightly toast them; spread butter on rolls. Assemble sandwich(es) by placing eggs and bacon on bottom half of roll, and then topping with gouda. Broil for a minute or two to melt the cheese. Serve to a mom in bed, preferably with fresh fruit and a mimosa. Perfecto!
