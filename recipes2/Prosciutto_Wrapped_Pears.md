This is not really a recipe so much as it is a reminder to myself that I really like both this and pears in general. Becky: you should eat more pears! 

- 2 pears, each cut into 8 wedges and cored
- 8 thin slices (4 oz.) prosciutto, cut in half lengthwise- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar

Wrap pear wedges with prosciutto and set on a serving plate. Add some arugula is you like. Drizzle with oil and vinegar.
