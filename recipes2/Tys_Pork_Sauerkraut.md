We have pork & sauerkraut on New Year's Day for good luck. This is Tyler's recipe and it is excellent! 

- 2 golden delicious apples, peeled/sliced- 2 pounds sauerkraut, drained
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 1/2 onion, sliced
- 2 slices bacon, chopped
- 1 cup white wine (Viogner/Riesling)- 1+ cup chicken broth
- 2 bay leaves
- 5 juniper berries/5 peppercorns
- 1/2 teaspoon fennel
- 2 teaspoons thyme/Herbs de Provence*- 3-4 pounds bone in pork shoulder

Saute bacon in an oven proof Dutch oven pan. When rendered add onion, salt, pepper. Saute on medium until soft/brown. Remove from pan. Add canola oil if needed. Add pork and brown on all sides and remove. Add apples and brown. Deglaze with wine and scrape pan. 

Add bacon, onion, pork, apples back to pan, and add sauerkraut. Add broth and wine to about 1/2 way up the pork. Cover and bake at 325 for 4-5 hours. (3 pound shoulder may take only ~3 1/2 hours.) 

*Trader Joes has a great Herbs de Provence mix.
