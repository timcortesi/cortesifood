These look like less good versions of the other cookie we call Snowballs, because these don't have chocolate chips or pecans or colored sugar. But I suppose you could still make them to mix it up. 

- 1 cup butter
- 1/4 cup confectioner sugar, plus more to roll in- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/8 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup chopped almonds

Preheat oven to 350. Cream butter and 1/4 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add almond extract and vanilla and blend well. Form dough into small balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Roll in confectioner sugar and cool. 

Makes 6 dozen.
