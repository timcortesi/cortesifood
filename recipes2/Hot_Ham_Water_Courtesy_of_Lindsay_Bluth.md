Canned ham Pot of water 

"Check it out! I found that canned ham, and I put it ina pot of boiling water, and guess what I'm calling it?" "Soup?" 
"Hot ham water." 

"T'm so hungry..." 

"Would you like to try... some of this?" "It's so watery! And yet there's a smack of ham to it!" 

(Mom, it's a joke. You won't get it.)
