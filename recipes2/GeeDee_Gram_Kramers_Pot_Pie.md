This recipe makes pot pie the traditional Pennsylvania Dutch way, which is not actually a pie at all and is instead a kind of hearty chicken stew made with homemade noodles. The Kramer family loves loves LOVES pot pie. They get sad when they go to a restaurant outside of southeastern Pennsylvania and see it listed on the menu because it is never the "REAL" pot pie. Tyler claims that everyone always bought lunch at school on pot pie day. If you're interested in the Cortesi family pot pie which actually IS a pie, that recipe is in Book 1. Cortesi family style Chicken Pot Pie is Dad's favorite. 

- 1-2 quarts chicken stock/broth/bouillon
- 4-6 medium sized diced potatoes
- 1-2 grated carrots (optional, if you want to add hidden- veggies; celery also optional)
- About 2 cups cooked chicken; diced or shredded
- Parsley, dried or fresh chopped
- Ingredients for dough (see below)

Place broth into large pot with potatoes and carrots and bring to boil. Reduce to slower simmer to partially cook 

potatoes while you make the pot pie dough. 

(continued on next page)
- Pot Pie dough:
- 2 cups flour
- 6 Tablespoons soft butter- 1 large egg
- 1/4 tsp baking powder

Mix all dough ingredients together, adding warm water a little at a time till it forms a soft dough ball. On floured surface, working 1/4-1/2 of dough at a time, roll out dough to desired thickness, about 1/4 inch. Cut dough into 1-1 1/2 inch squares, flouring them generously, as this will help slightly thicken your broth as it all cooks together. 

Bring the simmering broth back to a rolling boil as you drop the pot pie squares into the pot, gently stirring after each handful to help moisten and separate the dough squares. Continue until all the dough is in the pot and reduce heat to a slower simmer. 

Add shredded cooked chicken and parsley to taste and simmer slowly till dough is cooked through, stirring frequently for 30-40 minutes. Broth should also slightly thicken, but if more liquid is needed, add additional broth. 

Serve to some hungry Kramers!
