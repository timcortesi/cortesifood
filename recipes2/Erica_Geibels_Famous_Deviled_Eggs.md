Tyler LOVES these deviled eggs. Erica claims she doesn't know how to give me a recipe for them because "it's egg yolk and then some mayonnaise and then some salt and pepper and whatever else I want to put in it". But whatever she does put it in it is magic. 

Here are the instructions John gave me: 
"Boiled eggs until they are done-ish. Cut them in half. Whisk the yolks with mayonnaise until they are creamy- ish. Add some seasonings from some jars. Put mixture into eggs until they are full-ish. Never sprinkle paprika on top of them to deny John happiness." 

And there you have it. Now you too can make Ms. Erica's famous deviled eggs.
