I love chicken cordon bleu. This one is a lightened version that is still really good. Cooking Light suggests serving it with mashed potatoes and a side of green beans. 

- 1/4 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
- 5 teaspoons butter, melted
- 1 large garlic clove, minced
- 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 4 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 thin slices prosciutto (about 2 ounces)
- 1/4 cup (1 ounce) shredded part-skim mozzarella

Preheat oven to 350°. Place broth in a small bowl; microwave on high 15 seconds or until warm. Stir in butter and garlic. Combine breadcrumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and paprika in a medium shallow bowl]; set aside. 

Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy- duty plastic wrap, and pound each to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with salt, oregano, and pepper. Top each with 1 slice of prosciutto and 1 tablespoon mozzarella. Tightly roll up each, dip in chicken broth mix, dredge in breadcrumb mix. Place rolls, seam side down, in an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray. Pour remaining broth mixture over chicken. Bake at 350° for 28 minutes or until juices run clear and tops are golden.
