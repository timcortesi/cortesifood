The kids and I made this one year for people for Christmas, and got lots of complements on how pretty the jars looked. Rachel got the one that looked slightly less pretty because it fell over while we were assembling it. 

Layer the following this order in a 1 pint jar (or double the quantities and layer in a 1 quart jar instead). Make sure you tamp down each layer and try to keep excess spice dust from getting on the glass, in order to keep the layers looking pretty. 

- 18 cup dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon taco seasoning
- 1 tablespoon dried onion flakes- 1 tablespoon taco seasoning
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon white cornmeal
- 1 tablespoon taco seasoning
- 1 tablespoon garlic granules
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1/2 cup dried pinto bean
- 18 cup small dried white bean- 18 cup small dried black beans- 1/2 cup dried kidney beans

Attach the following instructions to the jar when you give this as a gift, or make it yourself. These instructions are for the 1 pint jar so make sure to double these quantities if you are using a 1 quart jar. 

- 1 medium diced onion
- 4 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato paste
- 12 cup cider vinegar
- 12 cup brown sugar
- 49 ounces tomato juice
- 2 Ibs ground beef or turkey, browned

Pour contents of jar into 6-quart pot. Add above listed ingredients. Fill remainder of the pot with water. Bring to boil. Let simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Add salt and pepper to taste. 

Serves 6.

Well, my computer was running out of battery so Madame Gooey No Nap and IJ had to relocate downstairs after [page 65](Aunt_Wendys_Manhattan_Clam_Chowder.md), so I could plug in the computer. So now we're in the playroom. Where she is growling and goo-ing up all the things down here. Gymnast Big Sister is still passed out upstairs.
