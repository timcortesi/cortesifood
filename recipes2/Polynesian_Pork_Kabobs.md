Mom suggests trying this at camp site 54 on Long Island on Lake George. This is also where she digs up all the driftwood. Dad loves when Mom digs up driftwood.

- 1 cup ketchup
- 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons dry sherry
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root

- Kabobs:
- 1 1/2 pound country style boneless pork ribs, cut into- 1 1/2” pieces
- 6 green onions, cut into 2” lengths
- 1 medium yellow bell pepper, cut into 1” squares
- 1 medium red bell pepper, cut into 1” squares
- 1 can pineapple chunks

In large resealable plastic bag, combine all marinade ingredients; blend well. Add pork ribs; turn to coat. Seal bag; refrigerate 3 hrs or overnight, turning once or twice. 

Drain meat, reserving marinade. Alternately thread pork and vegetables and pineapple on 6 (12 to 14”) metal skewers; brush with marinade. When ready to barbecue, place kabobs on grill 4-6” over medium coals. Cook 15 to 20 minutes or until pork is no longer pink and vegetables are tender, turning & brushing occasionally with marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Serves 6.
