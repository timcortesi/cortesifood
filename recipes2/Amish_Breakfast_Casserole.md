A new overnight breakfast casserole. Good for serving a large group (like a bunch of Cortesis visiting for Christmas.) Mom suggests serving with blueberry muffins or schneckens. I don't suggest hosting Christmas while you are 9 months pregnant. (Although we did have fun!) 

- 1 Ib. sliced bacon, diced, or 2 (10 oz) packages brown- serve sausage (Tyler's favorite), cut into 1/2" pieces
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 9 eggs, slightly beaten
- 4 1/2 cups frozen shredded hash browns, thawed
- 2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 1/2 cups small curd cottage cheese
- 1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
- 1/4+ tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/4+ tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 green pepper, diced (optional)

In a large skillet, cook bacon or sausage and onion until bacon is crisp or sausage is done; drain. In a bow], combine the remaining ingredients; stir in bacon (sausage) mixture. Transfer to a greased 15" x 10" x 2" baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake, uncovered, for 35-40 minutes or until set and bubbly. (May broil at the end to brown the top, if desired). Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting. 

Serves 10-12.
