Mom makes these to go on top of her Beef Stew, which you can find in Book #1 on [page 39](Mini_Bagel_Pizzas.md). 

- 3 tablespoons margarine
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup milk
- 3 tablespoons snipped parsley or chives

Cut margarine into flour, baking powder and salt and parsley until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in milk. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto hot meat or vegetables in boiling stew (do not drop directly into liquid). Cook uncovered 10 min. Cover and cook about 10 min longer. 

Yield: 8-10 dumplings.
