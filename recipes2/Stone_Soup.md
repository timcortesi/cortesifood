This is the actual recipe from the actual Stone Soup book. You can check. Making stone soup is a thing that the kindergartners do at Henry's school. As in they actually cook it in the classroom after they read this book. #kindergarten #cute #soup #henry #hashtags #whatisthepurposeofhashtagsanyway

Hey, now Ms Adelyn is up! Actually she woke up on [page 78](Brazilian_Feijoada_crock_pot.md) but there wasn't room on that page to tell you. Also the baby has now started pulling all the clean folded laundry out of the laundy basket onto the floor. So I supposed I should take a brief editing hiatus to stop that from happening.
