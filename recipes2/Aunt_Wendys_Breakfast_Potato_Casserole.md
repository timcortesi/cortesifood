Grandmother had this at Aunt Wendy's house and then made it for the Cortesi family when we were visiting over Thanksgiving weekend. It is delicious! 

- 24 ounces frozen sausage or cooked ham diced or- bacon crumbled
- 16 ounces frozen shredded hash browns
- 1 cup onion, minced
- 2 cups milk
- 16 ounces colby jack cheese, shredded & divided
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (Aunt Wendy doesn't add this)
- 6 eggs slightly beaten
- Salsa for serving

Grease a 9x13" baking dish. Brown bacon or sausage. In a large bowl, combine meat, hash browns, onions, milk, 3 cups of cheese, salt, and eggs. Pour mixture into baking dish. Top with remaining cheese. Refrigerate covered for several hours or overnight. Bake at 350 degrees for 50-55 minutes or until knife inserted near center comes out clean. Let stand covered for 10 minutes before serving. Serve with salsa. Enjoy.

Guess whether the baby is still screaming her head off? (See [page 21](Tylers_Seasonal_Frittatas.md) if you have no idea what I'm talking about.) Yes. Yes she is. #everythingisawesome
