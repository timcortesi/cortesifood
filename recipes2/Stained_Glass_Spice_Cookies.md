These are the cookies that you cut out and the melt tiny pieces of lifesavers in, to make "stained glass" window panes. I always thought they were cool looking. You can hang them up for decorations. 

- 1 cup margarine, softened
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 3/4 cup flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 10-12 rolls of lifesavers (or lollipops) of assorted- colors - but don't use pineapple (clear) or purple

Line 3-4 cookie sheets with aluminum foil and spray with pam (or try parchment paper?). Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk and beat until well blended. Combine separately: flour, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and baking power. Gradually add to butter mixture until dough can be gathered into a (crumbly) ball. Divide dough in quarters, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate 15-30 minutes (until firm). 

Meanwhile, crush like-color lifesavers with a hammer in heavy duty ziploc bags.

Preheat oven to 350. Place 1/4 dough between 2 sheets of wax paper and roll to 1/8" thick. Cut into desired shapes with 3" cookie cutters. Put cookies on prepared cookie sheets. If desired, make a small hole at the top (to hang). Cut out shapes in each cookie with a knife or small cookie cutter. 

Fill cutouts with crushed candy, using 1 color in each cut out. Bake 8-10 minutes or until light brown and candy has melted. Cool on cookie sheets until candy hardens - about 10 minutes. Remove cookies and carefully peel off foil. Cool completely on wire racks. 

Makes 3 1/2 dozen.
