Henry and Adelyn love when we make these in October. Well - at least Henry loves them. Adelyn loves the idea of them but doesn't actually prefer to eat the peppers. 

Basically to make these you just make regular stuffed peppers (see [page 80](Hot_Ham_Water_Courtesy_of_Lindsay_Bluth.md) in Book 1) but instead of using green peppers you use orange peppers, and before you stuff them you cut holes in the sides to make a jack o'lantern face.
