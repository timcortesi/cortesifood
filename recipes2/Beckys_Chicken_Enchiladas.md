Yes, there are already 3 enchilada recipes in Book #1, and now there are 3 more in here. But can you ever really have too many enchiladas?? When I make this recipe I like to double it (and use both kinds of soup) and freeze half. 

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 3/4 cup chopped green onions
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken or celery soup
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast meat
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- 6 (12 inch) tortillas (I like the half corn half flour ones- from Trader Joes, or just regular corn tortillas)
- 1/4 cup milk

Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease a large baking dish. 
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the green onion until tender (about 3 to 4 minutes). Add the garlic powder, then stir in the green Chile's, soup and sour cream. Mix well. Reserve 3/4 of this sauce and set aside. To the remaining 1/4 of the sauce in the saucepan, add the chicken and 11 cup of shredded cheese. Stir together. 

Fill each tortilla with the chicken mixture and roll up. Place seam side down in the prepared baking dish. Ina small bowl combine the reserved sauce with the milk. Spoon this mixture over the rolled tortillas and top with the remaining shredded cheese. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
