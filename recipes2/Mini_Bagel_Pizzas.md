These are great to keep in your freezer for when you (or the kids or whoever) need a quick lunch or snack. Sisters are good for making these for you while you are pregnant/nursing. 

Mini bagels 
Tomato sauce of your choosing 
Shredded mozzarella cheese 
Toppings of your choosing (pepperoni, sausage, etc) 

Separate bagels into halves and lay cut side up on cookie sheet. Cover top of each half with tomato sauce followed by (lots of mozzarella cheese). If desired, add toppings. If you want to eat these now, put however many you want to eat in the toaster oven or regular oven until bagel is toasted and cheese is melted. Freeze any you don't want to eat now on the cookie sheet until firm, and then move to a gallon ziploc bag to heat up later.
