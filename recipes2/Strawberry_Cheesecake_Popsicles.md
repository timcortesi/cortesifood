I have never made these, but Tyler wants me to. Probably good in the spring/early summer when you're looking for something to do with the strawberries you just picked. 

- 1 (5-ounce) can evaporated low-fat milk- 1/4 cup sugar 3 ounces
- 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons light-colored corn syrup
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 10 ounce strawberries, hulled
- 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs

Combine milk and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; cook 3 minutes. Place cream cheese in a medium bow]; gradually add milk mixture, whisking until smooth. Stir in yogurt and vanilla. Cool completely. 

Place corn syrup, juice, and berries in a blender; process until smooth. Divide half of cream cheese mixture among 6 (4-ounce) ice-pop molds. Top with strawberry mixture, followed by remaining cream cheese mixture. Stir slightly with a skewer. Freeze 4 hours or until solid. 

Unmold ice pops; dip tips in graham cracker crumbs.
