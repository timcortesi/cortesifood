Great recipe to make to feed a crowd, like to bring to a potluck dinner, or when you have a bunch of friends coming over for a kid birthday party. Keep the recipe handy when you serve it because people will ask for a copy. Rich and gooey yummy-ness. 

- 4 cups uncooked macaroni
- 4 cups shredded cheese (any flavor; delicious is mostly- cheddar with some mozzarella thrown in)
- 4 cups small curd cottage cheese
- 2 sticks butter
- 2 cups boiling water
- Optional: ham or whatever else you feel like adding

Spray a 5-6 quart crock pot with cooking spray. Pour the layer of uncooked noodles on the bottom. Top with shredded cheese(s). (You can add ham in this layer if you like.) Top with cottage cheese. Cube sticks of butter and distribute evenly on the top. 

Run a knife quickly around the edge to make room for the water to ooze down the sides. Pour the 2 cups of boiling water into the crock pot. Put on the lid and turn it on high for 2 1/2 hours without peeking. (It is sometimes done in 2 1/4 hours, so you can check and maybe stir it up then, but it isn't really necessary.) 

Serves 6.
