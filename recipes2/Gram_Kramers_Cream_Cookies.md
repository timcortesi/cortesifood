This is Tyler's grandmother's (his dad's mom's) recipe for sugar cookies, perfected by Tyler's mom. Tyler loves loves LOVES these and Dee (Ty's mom) makes them for many occasions (Easter, Halloween, whenever). The cookies freeze well if you want to make them ahead & decorate/eat them later. Make sure you use the salted butter or Tyler will tell you they don't taste quite right. 

- 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 pound salted butter
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 pint heavy cream
- 6 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- Decorations of your choosing; the Kramers usually use- vanilla frosting & colored sugars/sprinkles

Preheat oven to 350. Cream together sugar and butter. Beat in eggs. Alternate adding the heavy cream and flour until mixed. Add baking soda and vanilla and mix. 

For soft cookies don't over-add extra flour when rolling out. Roll out somewhat thick (about 1/4") and slightly "underbake". 

Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes until just starting to brown slightly at edges. Cool before decorating.
