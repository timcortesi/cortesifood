Someone should make Dad eat this even though the "spaghetti" is really squash and it has spinach in it. It's still so good. It takes a while to make but there are some steps you can do ahead. It is originally from Cooking Light. 

- 2 small spaghetti squash (about 1 1/2 pounds each)
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 (8 ounce) package fresh baby spinach
- 1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 ounces shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese- (about 1/2 cup), divided
- 8 ounces 93% lean ground turkey
- 1 1/2 cups lower-sodium marinara sauce (such as- Dell'Amore)
- 1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about 1/4 cup)

Preheat oven to 350°. Cut each squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds; discard. Place squash halves, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Bake for 50 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Scrape inside of squash with a fork to remove spaghetti-like strands. Place strands on a clean dish towel; squeeze until barely moist. To save the squash for future use you can stack the emptied squash "boats" between damp paper towels, put the "noodles" in a plastic bag, and store both in the fridge.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add garlic; cook 30 seconds. Add spinach; cook 1 minute or until spinach wilts. Remove from heat. Combine spinach mixture, squash strands, ricotta cheese, salt, and half of mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl. 

Return skillet to medium-high heat. Add turkey to pan; cook 4 minutes or until browned, stirring to crumble. Add marinara sauce; cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 4 minutes. Remove from heat. 

Increase oven temperature to 425°. Spoon sauce evenly into the bottom of each squash half. Top evenly with squash mixture. Sprinkle evenly with remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Bake at 425° for 20 minutes. 

Preheat broiler to high (keep squash in oven). Broil squash 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese is golden brown and bubbly. 

Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes. 

Serves 4.
