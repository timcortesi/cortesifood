Tyler makes this for the kids at least once or twice a week, pretty much every week (especially when it is cold out). They love it and request it often. 

- 1 1/2 cups water
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup of steel cut oats
- Toppings of your choice; below are two different- versions our kids especially love

Bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt. Add oats. Let boil for 1 minute. Cover and remove from heat. Let sit overnight. Reheat the next morning either on the stove or in the microwave. 

Maple cinnamon blueberry: Add maple syrup and cinnamon to taste. Top with frozen blueberries (we like the frozen Maine blueberries from Trader Joes) and cream or milk. 

Ginger peach: Follow maple cinnamon blueberry instructions but use powdered ginger instead of cinnamon, and use (defrosted and pureed) frozen peaches instead of blueberries. 

You could also try brown sugar and raisins, strawberries and cream/honey, etc, etc.
