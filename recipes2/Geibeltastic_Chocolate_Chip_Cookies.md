The Geibels made these once and Henry raved about them for weeks. Why are they better than the ones I make? Who knows. The raisins? The kid doesn't even like raisins. But whatever. I'm definitely not jealous that Henry likes another mom's cookies better than mine. 

- 1 cup butter, softened- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 eggs
- 2 1/4 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup chocolate chips
- 1 cup raisins
- 1 cup chopped nuts

Preheat oven to 375. In a large bowl, cream the butter, sugars, and vanilla until fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl, and gradually beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Stir in the chips, raisins, and nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. (I recall the Geibels making them larger than this.) Bake at 375 for 8- 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool slightly before removing cookies from cookie sheet to rack.
