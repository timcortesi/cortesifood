This recipe is originally from the book "Don't Panic, More Dinner's In the Freezer" which is a cookbook that I love and highly recommend if you want to do freezer cooking (more on this on [page 270](Do_Freezer_Cooking.md)). Serves 6. 

- 6 fresh, boneless chicken breasts
- 10 ounces monterey jack cheese with jalapenos
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 1/4 cup bottled salsa (not chunky) or taco sauce (mild)- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups panko breadcrumbs
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 cup butter
- For serving: sliced avocado, cherry tomatoes, sour cream

Cut monterey jack cheese into 6 equal pieces measuring approximately 1/2 x 4". Cut a horizonal slit into the side of each chicken breast (not all the way through). Place one piece of cheese in each. Secure the cheese in the pocket with 2-3 wooden toothpicks. 

In a shallow pie plate, mix together eggs, salsa, and salt. In a separate pan, combine all ingredients starting with panko breadcrumbs through the oregano. Dip each chicken in the egg mixture to coat, then dip in panko mixture. Place coated breasts in a shallow baking dish. Place butter in a 9x13 baking dish and put in oven while it preheats to 375. Remove pan as soon as butter is melted, and add chicken, turning to coat. Bake 35-40 minutes.
