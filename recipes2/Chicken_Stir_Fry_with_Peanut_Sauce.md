This was a (modified) random find from Cooking Light a few years ago, but makes for a good and easy meal. 

- 2 teaspoons dark sesame oil, divided
- 1 pound chicken cutlets, trimmed
- 1/2 cup sliced onion
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1 large red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/4 cup light coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce- 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha (or less if you don't like spicy)- 2 teaspoons grated lime rind
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 cup unsalted cashews

Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil; swirl to coat. Add chicken; cook 1 minute on each side. Remove chicken from pan; cut into thin slices. Add onion, broccoli, and bell pepper to pan; stir-fry 2 minutes; add garlic. Stir-fry another 2 minutes or until vegetables are lightly browned. Reduce heat to medium-high. Combine remaining 1 teaspoon oil, coconut milk, and next 7 ingredients (through cumin) in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add chicken and coconut milk mixture to pan; cook 30 seconds. Sprinkle evenly with cashews. 

Serves 4.
