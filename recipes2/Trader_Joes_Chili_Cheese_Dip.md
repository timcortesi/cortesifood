Like the Trader Joe's Lentil Dip a few pages back (see [page 48](Trader_Joes_Lentil_Dip.md)), this is less "cooking" and more "dumping random pre-made stuff in a bowl and stirring", but no matter. It still tastes good. #traderjoes #dip #lazy #iknowyouarebutwhatami 

1 can Trader Joe's Turkey Chili (or use whatever chili you want; Rachel I think Trader Joe's has a vegetarian version of their canned chili) 
1 container Trader Joe's Pub Cheese 
Tortilla chips 

Dump amounts of your choosing of both the chili and pub cheese into some heating vessel (such as a bowl you plan to put in the microwave, or a small crock pot, or whatever). Mix. Heat. Mix again. Eat with chips. Repeat.
