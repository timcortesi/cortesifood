This is excellent. When we had it (when a friend brought it over after Elizabeth was born) Henry ate two bowls and Adelyn even ate all of the green. I recommend serving it 
with cornbread. It is modified from a recipe originally on Sally's Baking Addiction. 

- 2 (14 ounce) cans petite diced tomatoes, drained
- 2 (7 or 8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
- 1 1/2 lbs skinless boneless chicken breasts (~2 large)- 1 cup low sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 cup yellow onion, diced
- 1 large green bell pepper, diced
- 1 package of frozen corn (about 14 ounces)
- 1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 small jalapefio, minced (remove seeds and ribs)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1-2 teaspoons chili powder (you decide how much)
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- Additional salt and pepper to taste
- Toppings as desired - cilantro, cheese, sour cream, etc

Put everything in a crock pot (4 quarts or larger). Stir. Cook on low for 6-7 hours or high for 3 hours. Remove the chicken and chop or shred into pieces. Return to crock pot and stir. Taste and add more salt or add ground black pepper if desired. Serve with toppings as you prefer.
