This is another recipe that I do not remember making but sounds pretty good assuming Dad does not do the voice of the lamb while you are cooking it. Mom says she had these for lunch one time while camping with Aunt Heidi and they were VERY good (except Tony didn't like them.) 

- 1 pound ground lamb
- 1/2 cup finely crushed cracker crumbs- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 egg
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 3 (6”) pitas

- 1/2 cup chopped seeded tomato
- 1/2 cup chopped seeded cucumber
- 1/2 cup sliced green onions
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh or 1 teaspoon dried basil- 1 teaspoon fresh or 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh or 1/2 teaspoon dried mint- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt

(instructions on next page)
In a large bowl, combine all burger ingredients except pitas; mix well. Shape mixture into six patties shaped like half moons (to fit in pita halves). When ready to barbecue, place patties on grill, 4-6” over med-high coals. Cook 10 to 15 min or until no longer pink, turning once. 

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the ingredients for the salad topping. 

Wrap pocket breads in 18x12” piece of foil; place on grill to warm last 5 min of cooking. 

Cut pitas in half; place 1 cooked patty in each half. Spoon salad topping into pitas with patties. 

Serves 6.
