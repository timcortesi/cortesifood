Or instead of making this yourself, go visit Rachel in North Carolina where she is Bonefish Grill Head Wait Extraordinaire! Editor's note: Actually not any more because she changed jobs to work at an even fancier restaurant since the initial writing of this book. But you can still visit her. And April and Hank and Baby Hank.

(instructions on next page)
Combine all ingredients for chili sauce in a small bowl. Cover the sauce and set it aside. 

Combine the beaten egg with milk in a shallow bowl. Mix flour, panko, salt, pepper, sage, onion powder, garlic powder, and basil in another shallow bowl. 
Bread the shrimp by first coating each with the breading, then dipping in the egg and milk mixture, then back in the breading. Put the breaded shrimp in the fridge for at least 20 minutes to help the breading to stick on the shrimp when they are frying. 

Heat as much shortening or oil as needed by your fryer to 350 degrees. When the oil is hot, fry the shrimp for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Drain on a rack or paper towels. 

Gently toss shrimp with about 1/4 cup of sauce in a large bowl. Stack the shrimp on a bed of mixed greens, then chopped green onion. 

Serves 2 to 4 as an appetizer. Note: To make ahead, you can flash fry the shrimp for 45 seconds, let cool, and freeze in a ziploc bag. When you 

are ready to eat: fry for an additional 3 minutes and finish the rest of the recipe as written.
