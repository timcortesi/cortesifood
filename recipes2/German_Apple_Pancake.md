This is another recipe that Tyler makes on the weekend, especially in the fall when we have apples. The kids do actually like this one. It looks fancy immediately after it comes out of the oven because it puffs up. 

- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 2/3 cup half and half, or milk if you don't have that- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 to 4 large apples, peeled, cored, sliced- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- Confectioners’ sugar for dusting

Preheat the oven to 425. Whisk together flour, granulated sugar, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together eggs, half and half / milk, and vanilla. Combine the wet and dry ingredients, mixing until no lumps remain. Melt the butter in a 10" ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add the apples, brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook until the apples are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Quickly pour the batter around the edge of the skillet and then over the apples. Place the skillet in the oven and bake until the pancake has risen above the edges of the skillet and is brown, about 18 minutes. Loosen the edges with a spatula and invert onto a serving plate. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and cut into wedges to serve. Serves 4.
