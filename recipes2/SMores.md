Adulting Pro-Tip: Being an adult means you can decide what you want in your pantry. If you, like me, want to dedicate an entire section of your pantry to stocking fixings for s'mores and call it "The S'Mores Drawer", no one can stop you. Not even your lame husband who sometimes mocks "The S'Mores Drawer". But does he still eat the s'mores on firepit night? Yes, yes he does. 

Another Adulting Pro-Tip: Good S'Mores Drawers are well stocked with a variety of ingredients including not only the traditional marshmallows, Hershey bars, and cinnamon graham crackers, but also with Reeses peanut butter cups, chocolate graham crackers, and leftover Easter peeps. Easter peeps make excellent s'mores because the sugar on the outside gets all caramelized and delicious. 

- For the traditionalist, try:
- 1 Hershey bar, split into quarters
- 4 large marshmallows
- 4 graham crackers, each broken in half

Place 1/4 Hershey bar on each of 4 cracker halves. Roast marshmallow on a stick over campfire coals until golden brown. Place each toasted marshmallow on top of the chocolate sections; top each with the other cracker half. Press together and hold for a few seconds to melt chocolate. Serves 4.
