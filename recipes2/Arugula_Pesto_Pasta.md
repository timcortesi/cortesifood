This is another very easy dish that is great for a weeknight. It is also another dish that I tend to buy the stuff for from Trader Joe's, but again, you can buy equivalent ingredients wherever. Pasta pasta time to eat your pasta... 

- 12 ounce (3/4 bag) penne pasta
- 1 (16 ounce) package Sweet Basil Pesto Chicken- Sausage, sliced, or equivalent
- 1 (8 ounce) container refrigerated Genova Pesto or- 1 (8 ounce) jar Pesto alla Genovese, or equivalent
- 3.5 ounce (1/2 package) arugula
- Shredded or grated parmesan cheese

Cook pasta according to package instructions. While pasta is cooking, pan-fry sausage in lightly oiled pan. When pasta is cooked, drain, and immediately stir in pesto until noodles are coated. Toss in warm sausage slices and arugula. Heat from the pasta will slightly wilt the arugula. Serve, and add a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Serves 6.
