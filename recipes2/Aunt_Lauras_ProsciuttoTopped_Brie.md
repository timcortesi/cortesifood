An excellent before dinner snack that we had at Canoe Island Lodge a few times. 

- 1 whole firm-riped Brie round (80z)
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped dried sundried tomatoes- in oil, drained (reserve oil)
- 1 oz thinly sliced prosciutto, slivered

Cut cheese in half, lengthwise. Place outside up, in a greased shallow baking dish, just slightly larger than 
the cheese. Spread with the sundried tomatoes (make sure they are drained of oil). Mix prosciutto with 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil from the tomatoes and mound over the cheese. The prosciutto-topped brie may be refrigerated until the next day. 

Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven until the cheese is melted at edges and warm in center.
