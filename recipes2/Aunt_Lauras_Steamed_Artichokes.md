I had these once when I was out in California visiting the Wilkens family, and they are excellent! 

- 2 artichokes
- 2 tablespoons of water
- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
- Dip: Mayo, balsamic vinegar, or a mayo or vinegar based- salad dressing

Cut off stems so artichokes stand up straight. Place in container with lid that can be used in microwave 
Add water and lemon juice, and microwave on high for 6 minutes (time is for 2 artichokes... may need to increase time if cooking more artichokes). 

Serve with dressing of your choice. (Dip the edges of the artichokes leaves before eating.) 

Yield: 2 artichokes
