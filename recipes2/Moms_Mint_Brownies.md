Mom used to make these sometimes when we were coming home from school. They are my favorite. There is another version of this recipe in Book 1, but this one has some additional info/details. #chocolate #andmint #andbrownies #andchocolate 

1 box of brownie mix Ingredients to make brownies as directed on the box 1 (5 0z) box of Necco Thin mints (in candy aisle) 
or 1 (4.6 0z) box of Andes mints 

Mix brownie mix as directed on the box and spread in a greased 9x13 pan. Bake at 350 for 5 min less than directed on the box (so bake for approx 20 min). Meanwhile, open the box of Necco mints or take all the wrappers off the Andes mints. 

At the end of the 20 min baking time, remove the brownies from the oven, and quickly position the mints in approx 5 rows of 4 mints across, covering the top of the brownies. (use all the mints) 

Return pan to the oven for 5 more min of baking time. When done, quickly spread melted mints over the entire top of brownies, to the edges. Allow to totally cool before trying to cut the brownies. Don't let your siblings cut the brownies in the middle before the ones along the edges are eaten first. Enjoy.
