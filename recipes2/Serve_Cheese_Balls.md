You must follow these instructions precisely in order to serve cheese balls the Cortesi family way. 

1. Obtain a canister of cheese balls. The blue cardboard one, with the yellow lid. (Do they even still make these any more?) If you can't find these, a knock off variety will do, but they won't be as good. 

2. Count out individual cheese balls onto each person's plate. Aim for about 7. Maybe 9 if it's a particularly generous sort of day. 
3. Regardless of what number is decided, each person must have the EXACT SAME NUMBER of cheese balls. 

Count twice to be sure. Count again. 

4. Debate with a sibling about whether THEY might have gotten MORE cheese balls than YOU. (They didn't.) 

5. Savor your precisely appointed cheese balls.
