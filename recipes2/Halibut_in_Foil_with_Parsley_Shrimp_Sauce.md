Very good, and Rachel might eat it because it is fish. Make this at Pine Point, at Camp Little Notch in upstate New York. Or at that campsite we go to in the Delaware Water Gap. It goes well with Dilled Alaskan Garden Medley (which is the recipe after this one). 

- Halibut:
- 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pound halibut fillet- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 1 small lemon, thinly sliced

- Sauce:
- 2 tablespoons margarine
- 4 teaspoon flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper
- 3/4 cup milk
- 1/4 cup small cooked shrimp (fresh, canned or frozen)- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese- 2 tablespoons chipped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon white wine
- Worcestershire sauce

Grease center of 18” square of heavy-duty foil; place fish on foil. Arrange onion and lemon slices over fish, reserving 3 lemon slices for garnish. Wrap securely, using double fold seals. When ready to cook, place packet 4-6” over medium-high coals. Cook 25 to 30 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork, turning once.

Meanwhile, melt margarine in medium saucepan. Stir in flour, salt and pepper; cook over medium heat until mixture is smooth and bubbly, stirring constantly. Gradually add milk. Cook over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes or until mixture boils, stirring constantly; cook 1 minute. Stir in shrimp, cheese, parsley and Worcestershire sauce; cook about 1 minute or until shrimp are thoroughly heated. 

Place cooked fish, lemon and onion slices on platter. Spoon sauce over fish. Garnish with reserved lemon slices 

and additional parsley, if desired. 

Serves 6.
