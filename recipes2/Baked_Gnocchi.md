This is a quick and easy weeknight dish that is great for when you want some filling delicious pasta. I usually get the gnocchi and vodka sauce from Trader Joes but you can get it wherever. #traderjoes #isawesome #waituntilyouseepage266 

- 1 (18 ounce) bag dry potato gnocchi
- 1 cup vodka tomato sauce or combine 3/4 cup- marinara with 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided
- Cooked pancetta or sausage (optional)
- 2 tablespoons bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 400. Cook gnocchi, following instructions on bag. When gnocchi float to the top, they are done. Drain. In a medium bowl, combine sauce, peas, basil, and 1/4 cup parmesan. Stir in gnocchi and meat if using. Lightly spray a small casserole dish (8 inch oval). 
Transfer gnocchi mixture to casserole. Top with remaining cheese or bread crumbs. Bake uncovered for 10 minutes. 

Serves 4.
