This is less a "recipe" and more just putting apples in a bowl and microwaving them, but I'm including it anyway because it is a good side dish that we grew up eating and I didn't put it in Book #1. 

4-6 apples (any eating variety) 
Butter 
Water 
Cinnamon (or cinnamon sugar if you prefer) 

Peel apples. Core and slice. Put in a microwave safe bowl with a little bit of water in the bottom and a couple dabs of butter on the top. Cover with a plate or saran wrap. Microwave for 5-6 minutes or until apples are soft (but not too soft). Remove cover (be careful because the steam will be HOT) and drain water. Sprinkle with cinnamon or cinnamon sugar and serve immediately.

Ok so where were we? Oh right, arriving home on [page 138](Pancetta_Wrapped_Pork_Roast.md). Then Henry had his piano lesson. He had sort of practiced (not without a lot of complaining) so he was sort of able to play the songs. I hung up the Advent calendars Mom made. Thanks Mom! Adelyn helped me. Elizabeth tried to climb up the steps. But I stopped her before she fell and cracked her head open. Because I am a pro at this mom-ing gig.
