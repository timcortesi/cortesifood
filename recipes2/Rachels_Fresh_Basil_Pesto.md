You can spread this on toasted baguette slices, or serve it with pasta, or over baked potatoes, or whatever you're in the mood for. I don't really have anything amusing to add about this one. It's pesto. How funny can pesto be? 

- 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/3 cup pine nuts or walnuts
- 3 med sized garlic cloves, minced- Salt and fresh ground black pepper

Combine the basil in with the pine nuts in a food processor. Pulse a few times. (Note: If you are using walnuts instead of pine nuts and they are not already chopped, pulse them a few times first before adding the basil.) Add the garlic, pulse a few times more. Slowly add the olive oil in a constant stream while the food processor is on. Stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula. Add the grated cheese and pulse again until blended. Add a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. 

Makes 1 cup. If you like, you can spray ice cube trays with Pam, freeze 

individual cubes of the Pesto, and then store them in the freezer in a ziploc bag.
