This is an interesting (and really really easy) cake to make because you literally just dump a bunch of stuff in a pan, don't mix it, and it magically becomes a cake. A friend of ours made it for us after I had Elizabeth. I'm told you can also do this with other fruit and cake mix combinations - cherries and chocolate cake mix, for example. 

- 2-3 cans of whatever fruit (she used peach), undrained- 1 box of cake mix (she used yellow)
- 1 cup of butter
- Cooking spray

Preheat oven to 350. Spray 9x13" cake pan. Spread 2-3 cans of fruit, with liquid, in pan. Dump the box of cake mix over the top. Melt the butter and pour on the top. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.
