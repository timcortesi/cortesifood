This is how Tyler makes brussel sprouts for us. They are really really good. Even Mom will like them and she doesn't even like brussel sprouts. #seriously #youshoulddefinitelytrythem #delicious 

- 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 1 pound fresh brussel sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 1 shallot, chopped (if you have one)
- 1/4-1/2 cup chicken stock
- 3 tablespoons to 1/4 cup maple syrup (the real stuff)- Salt and pepper to taste
- Dash of lemon juice

Cook the bacon in a frying pan until the fat is rendered out. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the bacon to a separate bowl; leave the fat in the pan. Add the the brussel sprouts (and shallot if you have it) to the hot fat and saute over medium high until crispy. Add chicken stock, scrape up the browned bits and put a lid on for 5-8 minutes. Take the lid off, and if there is any liquid remaining let it evaporate/boil off. Add 3 tablespoons-1/4 cup maple syrup, salt and pepper, and lemon juice, and stir to combine. Sprinkle bacon over the top.
