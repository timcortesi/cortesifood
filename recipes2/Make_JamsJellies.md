Pick your own fruit, and make your own jam. I actually really like making freezer jam (your box might have instructions, or you can Google it) because then you can just put it in the freezer instead of having to do the wax thing Mom always does. 

Fruit Box of Sure-Jell or Certo Sugar, if you need it 

Follow the directions in the box of either Sure-Jell or Certo. Both work equally well.
