Take all of the leftovers out of the fridge. Open and line up all of the containers on the counter. (Except not the hairy looking ones; toss those immediately because gross.) Insist that the family eat all of the leftovers before you make them another meal because WE ARE NOT WASTING FOOD HERE PEOPLE. 

Rachel & Andrew's favorite way to participate in Leftover Lunch was by making quesadillas, where they would put about 2 teaspoons of leftover chicken, 2 teaspoons from an entirely new can of refried beans they opened just for this quesadilla, and a massive amount of shredded cheese in a tortilla. Then they would put the almost entirely full can of refried beans back in the fridge until it grew hair. Bon Appetit!
