Andrew made this (originally from Once Upon a Chef) and brought it into work a couple years ago and everyone loved it. The dressing is similar to the salad dressing at Chipotle. You can make both Andrew and Rachel's recipes (see the previous page) and compare them and tell me which is better. #siblingrivalry 

- For the salad:
- 2 ears fresh corn
- 1 cup chopped red onion
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can black beans
- 1 red bell pepper, diced (about 1 cup)
- 1/2 cup cilantro (plus more for garnish if desired)- 1 avocado

- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, from 1-2 limes
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large garlic clove, roughly chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 3/4 teaspoon cumin
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 small (or 1 1/2 large) canned chipotle peppers in- adobo sauce (note this is 2 peppers, not 2 cans!)

(instructions on next page)
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the corn, cover, and turn heat down to low. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the corn from the water and let cool. 

Meanwhile, place the chopped red onions in a small bowl and cover with water. Let sit about ten minutes, then drain completely in a sieve and set aside. 

Place the beans in a sieve; run under cold water to rinse well. Let drain completely and set aside. 

Holding the cooled corn upright in a large bow], cut the kernels off the cob in strips. Add the beans, red onion, red bell pepper and cilantro. 

Make the dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a blender or mini food processor; process until smooth. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or, preferably, overnight. 

Right before serving, dice the avocado and add to the salad. Toss the salad gently, then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (the website recommends adding a squeeze of fresh lime to freshen it up). Garnish with a bit of fresh chopped cilantro if desired. Serve cold.
