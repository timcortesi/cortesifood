This is a beautiful pork roast that Tyler likes to make. The recipe is originally from the book "The Martha Stewart Living Cookbook: The New Classics". 

- 1 pork loin (1 1/2 pounds)
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus- several sprigs
- 1/4 pound pancetta or bacon, thinly sliced
- 8-10 cipollini or small white onions or shallots
- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon all purpose flour
- 1 cup chicken stock, preferably homemade

Preheat the oven to 375. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Sear the pork on all sides until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. 

Rub the pork with the chopped rosemary wrap with the pancetta, overlapping strips slightly. Lay a rosemary spring on top; tie the pork with kitchen twine. Scatter the onions/shallots and rosemary sprigs around the pork. Roast in the oven, basting occasionally with cooking juiced, until the internal temperature is 145, about 35-40 minutes. Remove from the oven; transfer to a platter and cover with foil.

Pour off the fat from the skillet; place over medium heat. Add the stock, scraping bottom of skillet to loosen browned bits. Bring to a boil; reduce the liquid slightly, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the butter mixture; cook until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with the pork and onions.

By the way. We did make it home from our trek to get Henry that started on [page 129](Tylers_Fig_Pig_Pizza.md). When we found him he was wearing his shirt backwards. So was his friend Frankie. Supposedly it was backwards day at school. Which he claimed meant he should get to eat dessert before dinner tonight. #backwardsday
