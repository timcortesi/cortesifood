Ok, this is the last of the Rachel baby shower appetizers. Thank you for making all this baby shower food for me, dear sister. You're the best. 

- 2 kiwis, peeled and diced
- 2 Fuji apples - peeled, cored and diced- 8 ounces raspberries
- 1 pound strawberries
- 3 tablespoons fruit preserves, any flavor- 10 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- Butter flavored cooking spray- Cinnamon sugar

In a large bowl, thoroughly mix kiwis, raspberries, strawberries, and fruit preserves. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes. Add apples last (maybe even just before. serving) 

Preheat oven to 350. Coat both sides of each flour tortilla with butter flavored cooking spray. Cut into wedges and dredge chips in cinnamon sugar. Arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. 

Bake in the preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with any remaining tortilla wedges. Allow to cool approximately 15 minutes. Serve with chilled fruit mixture.
