Mom asked the caterer from Becky and Tyler's wedding for the recipe for his potato salad because we all loved it so much. 

Large russet potatoes (baked & cooled not boiled) Chopped egg 
Small diced celery, carrot, & red onion 
Fresh chopped parsley & oregano 
Salt & pepper to taste 
Hellmans mayo 

Mix some quantity of all this stuff together and eat. (Rob didn't give us any more detailed instructions than 

this. He is also a professionally trained chef. His salad was super good but your results may vary.)

**Becky Rant:**
Now all the kids are in bed. Which you would know if you read [page 158](John_Geibels_Baked_Potatoes.md). And I have my own (fleece "mama bear") pajamas on. And Tyler has poured me a glass of wine. #win #nowitsaparty #its8pm #onafridaynight #thisishowipartynow #socool
