- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup Dijon mustard
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Herbes de Provence, or use thyme- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
- 6 medium carrots, roughly chopped
- 5 small parsnips, roughly chopped
- 3 small red potatoes, roughly chopped
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 450. Whisk together the olive oil, mustard, garlic, and herbs. Cut each chicken breast into three equal portions. Use a small spatula to spread a small portion (about 2 tablespoons total) of the mustard herb sauce mixture over the chicken. Season with salt and pepper and set aside in the fridge. 

Place the onion, carrots, parsnips, and red potatoes in a large baking dish. Season well with salt and pepper. Pour the remaining sauce mix over the vegetables and stir until well-combined. Cover with foil & cook for 30-35 minutes, or until the veggies are nearly tender when fork pierced. 

Nestle the chicken over the veggies, cover, and place back in the oven. Allow the chicken to cook for ~15-18 minutes. Uncover the dish and roast for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce mix begins to turn golden brown and the chicken is cooked through. Serves 4.
