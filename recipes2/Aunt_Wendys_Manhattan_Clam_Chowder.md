Full disclosure: I don't actually like Manhattan clam chowder. (I do love New England clam chowder though! Actually I think what I really love is just creamy potato soup; I could skip the clams.) But anyway, I am including this recipe because it's Aunt Wendy's recipe, and I know Grandmother LOVES this soup. So hopefully the rest of you will too. 

- 5 slices uncooked turkey bacon
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 4 ribs celery, diced
- 1/2 pound potatoes, diced
- 4 cups canned or bottled clam juice
- 32 ounces canned crushed plum tomatoes in puree- 1 1/2 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 pounds uncooked littleneck clams, shells scrubbed- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, minced

Saute bacon over medium high heat in a large heavy pot until crispy, about 5-6 minutes. Remove bacon and crumble; set aside. 

In the same pot, heat olive oil over medium heat about 1 minute. Add onion, carrots, celery, and potatoes and stir, scraping bacon drippings from bottom of pot with a wooden spoon, to mix and coat.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion wilts, about 10-15 minutes. Add clam juice, tomatoes, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook for about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 50 minutes. 

Add clams to soup, cover, and increase heat to high. Boil soup Just until clams open, about 6-8 minutes. Remove clams from shells, discard shells, and place clams back in soup. Toss in parsley and crumbled bacon and serve. Serves 8 (about 1 cup per serving).

Baby Elizabeth has actually been sitting here quietly with me since [page 58](Pigs_in_Blankets.md). Maybe she didn't like how her character was coming across in this book. All crazy and gooey. So she's being less crazy. She's still pretty gooey though. On the plus side, her big sister has been asleep for over an hour! It's a Friday afternoon and Adelyn has gymnastics on Friday mornings which always wears her out. And big brother Henry is still at school. And Tyler is at work. So it's just me and gooey.
