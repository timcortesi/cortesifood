This recipe is from Blue Apron. It is served with a creamy rice and topped with a cabbage slaw. I was too lazy to put those in the Sides section so they are included here. Deal. 

- 1/2 head of cabbage (about 1/2 pound), thinly sliced
- 6 ounces carrots, peeled and grated
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Juice from one lime
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 cups cooked jasmine rice, warmed
- 2 tablespoons creme fraiche
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 tablespoon "Mexican spice blend" (which consisted of- ancho chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder,- cumin, and dried mexican oregano; use what you like)
- 4 ounces shredded monterey jack cheese

Whisk together the mayonnaise, sugar, lime juice, a drizzle of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste, in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrots, and shallot, and stir to combine. Set aside to marinate at least 10 minutes. Mix the creme fraiche into the cooked rice. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt, pepper, and spice blend. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil on medium high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 6-7 minutes on the first site and 4 minutes on the other side. Carefully top with the cheese. Loosely cover the pan and cook 2-3 minutes until cheese is melted and chicken cooked. Serve the rice, chicken, and slaw.
