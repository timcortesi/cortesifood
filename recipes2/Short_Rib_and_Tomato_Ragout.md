I LOVE LOVE LOVE love this dish. It takes a while to make but it is totally worth it and you can mostly just leave it simmering and warming up your house which is perfect in the fall or winter. It is originally from Cooking Light & serves about 8. 

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 (6-ounce) bone-in short ribs, trimmed- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided- 2 cups finely chopped onion
- 3/4 cup finely chopped carrot
- 1/2 cup finely chopped celery
- 8 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 (28-ounce) can unsalted whole tomatoes- 12 ounces uncooked pappardelle

Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil; swirl to coat. Sprinkle ribs with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add ribs to pan; cook 10 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Place ribs on a plate. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to pan; cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water, tomato paste, basil, oregano, and tomatoes to pan, gently breaking up tomatoes with a spoon. Return ribs to pan. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 3 1/2 hours or until beef is very tender.
