This is an easy but good recipe that originally came from a Blue Apron order. It is served with sweet peppers and jasmine rice. You can make it as spicy or not spicy as you feel like. #spicyisbetter #butkids 

- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1/3 cup soy glaze
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 1/2 cup water, divided
- Sambal oelek to taste (1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon)- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste, divided
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
- 1/2 pound baby sweet peppers, cored and quartered- 2 scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 1/8 pounds diced beef

Combine the hoisin sauce, soy glaze, vinegar, 1/2 cup water, and sambal oelek in a bowl. Set aside. Combine the rice, garlic, a big pinch of salt, and 2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce heat to low; cover and cook 12-14 minutes until water has been absorbed. Turn off heat. 

While the rice cooks, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil on medium high until hot. Add the broccoli; season with salt and pepper. Cook -6 minutes until lightly browned. Add the peppers and white bottoms of the scallions. (continued on next page)
Cook 4-5 minutes until softened. Transfer to a bowl and wipe pan. 

Pat the beef dry with paper towels; place in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cornstarch; toss to coat. In the same pan used to cook the vegetables heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the coated beef in an even layer. Cook without stirring, 3-4 minutes, or until browned. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, 2-3 minutes, or until just cooked through. 

Add the cooked vegetables and sauce to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, 1-2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the cooked rice topped with the finished beef, vegetables, and sauce. Garnish with the sliced green tops of the scallions.
