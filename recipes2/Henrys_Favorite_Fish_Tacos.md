Henry's favorite food in the entire world is fish tacos. He loves them any way we make them, using any fish, and any cooking method, and any toppings (except cheese), and as long as he gets to eat them from the green plastic taco truck taco holder and not the dreaded orange one (seriously, he and Adelyn have a rotation). (You may obtain the aforementioned taco truck taco holders for yourself from Fred & Friends. Which is also where we got Andrew's pastasaurus. I digress.) Anyway, of all the ways we make fish tacos, cornmeal breaded and pan fried cod topped with pickled red onions is his favorite version. Tyler likes to add a slaw on the taco as well. Adelyn prefers hers with only cheese and no vegetables. I like avocados. Do what you want. This particular recipe is a modified version of the Cooking Light recipe for a cornmeal dusted catfish sandwich. And the recipe for red onions is from Kid Chef "The Foodie Kids Cookbook". 

Quick Pickled Onions (make these first because they take 

half an hour to marinate): 

- 1/2 red onion, sliced thin- Pinch black peppercorns- 1 bay leaf
- 3/4 cup white vinegar

Arrange the onion slices in a small jar or bowl. Add the peppercorns and bay leaf. Pour in enough white vinegar to 

cover. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. 

(instructions for fish and slaw on next page)
- Fish:
- Cod filets (I don't know how much. Enough for tacos- for 4 people. Maybe 1 filet each, 1.5 pounds total?)
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 1/2 tablespoons coarse cornmeal
- 2 teaspoons canola oil
- (continued on the next page)

Sprinkle fish with pepper and salt. Sprinkle with cornmeal. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil; swirl to coat. Add fish to pan; cook 4 minutes on each side or until done. Set aside; keep warm. 

- Slaw:
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons canola mayonnaise- 2 teaspoons stone-ground mustard- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup shredded green cabbage
- 1 cup shredded red cabbage
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced green apple

Combine first 5 ingredients (vinegar through pepper) in a medium bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add green cabbage, red cabbage, and sliced apple; toss to coat. 

Serve on warmed tortillas (we like the flour/corn mix ones from Trader Joes) with toppings as desired: cilantro, sour cream, a squeeze of lime, sliced avocado, cotija or cheddar cheese.... basically whatever you feel like adding.
