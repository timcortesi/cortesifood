Once upon a time (actually just a month ago) GeeDee accidentally invited her 96 year old distant cousin (? or some relation, we never quite figured out how they were related) to Thanksgiving dinner, and she came! Turns out she was actually a very nice little old lady, and she brought with her these cookies. They were very good, light, meringue-esque cookies that are neat because they cook while you "forget" them in the oven overnight. She described the recipe; I looked online and found one as similar as I could. 

- 2 large egg whites, at room temperature- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)- 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350. Cover a cookie sheet with foil and grease with butter. Beat the egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating the egg white until the hold stiff peaks. Add vanilla if desired. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared pan. Put the cookies in the oven and turn the oven OFF. Leave the cookies in the oven overnight (keep the door closed!) or about 10-12 hours. 

The internet suggests other variations as well, like adding chopped pecans, or adding 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa, or replacing the chocolate chips with toffee bits, or omitting the vanilla and adding 1/2 teaspoon of mint extract with a drop or two of green food coloring.
