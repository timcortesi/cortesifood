I don't remember much about this dish but I must have 
liked it because I asked Mom to give me the recipe. (Back in 2009. See how much I like you guys?? I'm finding you favorite recipes from 2009. 2009!) Serve over warm rice. 

- 2/3 cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1/8-1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 small onion, cut into thin wedges
- 1 red sweet pepper, cut into thin strips
- 3/4 pounds cooked turkey cut into bite-size strips- (about 3 cups)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Warm rice

For sauce, in a small mixing bowl, stir together the water, soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, curry powder, cornstarch, and crushed red pepper. Set aside. 
Coat a large skillet or wok with cooking spray. Add the onion wedges and sweet pepper strips; cook and stir over medium heat until tender. Stir in the turkey strips and garlic. Stir in sauce. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Serve over hot cooked rice.
