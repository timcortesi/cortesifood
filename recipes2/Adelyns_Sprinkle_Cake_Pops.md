This recipe is from the book "Kid Chef Bakes" (which, incidentally, I highly recommend.) Henry & Adelyn are excellent bakers and love making (and eating!) these cake pops! Makes 24 cake pops (or maybe less, depending on how much snacking you do along the way.) 

- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 1 stick butter, room temperature, divided- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup milk, divided
- 2 cups confectioner sugar
- White candy melts, about 2 (10 ounce) bags- 24 white lollipop sticks
- Sprinkles
- Cake pop stand (or block of foam works just as well)

Preheat the oven to 350. Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, beat 1/3 cup of butter with an electric mixer for about 10 seconds on medium speed or until smooth. Beat in the sugar until well combined and light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the vanilla. Alternate adding some of the flour mixture and 1/3 cup of milk to the butter mixture, beating on low until the batter is just combined.

Pour the cake batter into the pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool slightly, then remove the cake from the pan to finish cooling on a wire rack. 

While the cake is cooling, prepare the frosting. Ina medium bowl, add 4 tablespoons of butter (you will have a little butter left over) and beat with an electric mixer for about 10 seconds, or until smooth. Gradually beat in the confectioner sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of milk and beat until smooth, adding a little more milk (up to 4 tablespoons total including the 2 you already used) as needed. The frosting should be a little on the thicker side. 

When the cake is cool, crumble it into pieces. Add 1/4 cup of frosting and mix it together. Add a little more frosting at a time until the cake is fully crumbled and the mixture is clumpy. Form the cake mixture into 1" balls and place on a baking sheet lined with wax or parchment paper. Refrigerate for about 1 hour or until firm. 

Melt the candy melts following the instructions on the package (you can use a double boiler if you have one, or we just used the microwave). Stir very frequently, until the candy is melted and smooth. Dip about 1/4" of the tip of a lollipop stick into the melted candy melt, and then insert the stick into the cake ball. Dip the cake balls, one at a time, into the candy melts, covering the entire cake ball and just below to the stick. Before the candy melt hardens, sprinkle the sprinkles on top of the cake balls. Place each finished cake pop on a cake pop stand or in a foam block. ENJOY!
