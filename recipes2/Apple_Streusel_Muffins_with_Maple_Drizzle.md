This recipe is originally from Cooking Light September 2014, but we made some modifications like extra apples and more streusel for the topping. #becauseyoualwaysaddextraapples #obvi 

- Streusel:
- 4 tablespoons old-fashioned rolled oats- 4 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon- Muffins:
- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk*
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 2 Gala apples, diced (about 2 cups)- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon water
Preheat oven to 400°. Prepare streusel by combining ingredients in a bowl; set aside. 

To prepare muffins, combine flours, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Combine buttermilk, 1/2 cup sugar, oil, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and egg in a bowl. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until combined. Fold in apple. 

Divide batter among 12 paper-lined muffin cups; top evenly with streusel. Bake at 400° for 16 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging. Cool in pan 5 minutes. 

Remove from pan; cool completely. Combine powdered sugar, syrup, and 1/2 teaspoon water in a bow]; stir until smooth. Drizzle evenly over muffins. 

Serves 12. * If you don't have buttermilk you can mix 3/4 cup milk
