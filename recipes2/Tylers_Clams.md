This is how Tyler makes clams sometimes for his mom when she comes to visit. I don't really love clams but these are pretty good, and Dee and Henry LOVE them. 

- 100 littleneck (I think?) clams
- 4 slices bacon, diced or lardoned (see [page 88](Chicken_Lentil_Bacon_Stew.md))
- 1.5 cups dry white wine (sauvignion or Chardonnay)- Black pepper & salt to taste
- 2 diced shallots or 1/2 small onion
- Mix of fresh herbs, chopped (chives, thyme, tarragon,

parsley) Melted butter for serving 

Heat large pot on medium high, add bacon, and cook until fat is rendered and bacon crisp. Remove bacon and leave fat in pot. Add shallots or onion to bacon drippings & season w/ salt and pepper. Cook until translucent, stirring frequently. 

Add wine & clams to pot. Cover and adjust heat to maintain light simmer. Cook until clams open, about 10 minutes. 

Remove clams and broth to serving bowls, sprinkle 

generously w/ chopped fresh herbs and bacon and serve with warmed butter.
