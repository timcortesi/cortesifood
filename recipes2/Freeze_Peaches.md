Pretty straight forward, but just in case you need a "how to". You can freeze other fruits (apples, strawberries, etc) the same way. 

Peaches Ascorbic acid (if desired) Sugar (if desired) 

Peel and slice. Add ascorbic acid in accordance with directions on bottle if desired, to prevent browning. (This is unnecessary when using Golden Jubilee Peaches as they do not turn brown when they are cut.) Add sugar if desired. Lay individual slices or berries on cookie sheet and "flash freeze" for about 30 minutes, then pack in air tight container and freeze completely. (The "flash freezing" helps prevent the fruit from sticking together later).
