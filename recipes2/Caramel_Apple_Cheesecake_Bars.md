The wife of a friend of mine from work made these and they were soooo good that I asked for the recipe. I think the wife originally got the recipe from a blog called "The Girl Who Ate Everything". The chick who writes that blog originally got it from Paula Deen. Where Paula Deen got it from, I have no idea. Maybe she made it up or stole it from someone else. You should make this in the fall using fresh apples. 

- Crust:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar- 1 cup 2 sticks butter, softened

- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 3/4 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons, divided
- 3 large eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- Apples:
- 3 Granny Smith apples , peeled, cored, finely chopped- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- Topping:
- 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup quick cooking oats
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
- 1/2 cup caramel topping for drizzling after baked

(instructions on next page)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine flour and brown sugar. Cut in butter with a pastry blender (or 2 forks) until mixture is crumbly. Press evenly into a 9x13 baking pan lined with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bake 15 minutes or until lightly browned. 

In a large bowl, beat cream cheese with 3/4 cup sugar in an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth. Then add eggs, 1 at a time, and vanilla. Stir to combine. Pour over warm crust. 

In a small bowl, stir together chopped apples, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Spoon evenly over cream cheese mixture. 

For the streusel topping: In a small bowl, combine all ingredients. Blog girl recommends using clean hands to thoroughly combine the butter into the mixture. 
Sprinkle streusel topping over apples. Bake 40-45 minutes, or until filling is set. Drizzle with caramel topping and let 

cool. Serve cold and enjoy!
