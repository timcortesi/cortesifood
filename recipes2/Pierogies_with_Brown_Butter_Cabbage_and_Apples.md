This is a good way to use the 5 pound bag of frozen pierogies you bring home as leftovers from the Kramer family beach vacation. Make this while you listen to the "The 8 Polish Foods of Christmas" by Veggie Tales. 

- 1 (16 0z) package frozen pierogies (onion or cheese)- 1/2 small head savoy cabbage
- 4 tbsp (1/2 stick) butter
- 1/2 cup diced onions
- 1 Gala or Fuji or other tart crunchy apple
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley
- 1/4 cup low-fat sour cream
- Optional: applesauce as a side

Saute the pierogies according to the package directions. Core and thinly slice the cabbage and apple, and chop the parsley. 

Heat the butter on medium in a 12 inch skillet, 3-4 minutes until golden brown and fragrant, stirring often. Add the onions and cook 2 minutes. Add the cabbage and season with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet and cook 7 minutes, until cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally. 

Stir the apple into the cabbage and cook, uncovered, 2 minutes. Toss pierogies with cabbage. Serve topped with a dollop of sour cream, a side of applesauce (optional) and garnished with parsley. Serves 4.
