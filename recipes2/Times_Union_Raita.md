Mom and Dad made this along with the Lamb Curry and Coconut-Ginger Dal recipes also in this book (see pages 141 and 172). Mom recommends at least doubling this. Andrew - this is the yogurt sauce stuff you like. 

- 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder- 1/4 cucumber, peeled and shredded (1/2 cup)- 2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt

Toast cumin powder in a small skillet over low heat until fragrant. Let cool while peeling and shredding the 

cucumber. 

In a small bowl, combine cumin, cucumber and yogurt. Stir well to combine. Keep cold until ready to serve. 

Serves 4-6.

The best part about a Friday night party in your pajamas (see [page 169](Rob_The_Pig_Guys_Potato_Salad.md)) while you attempt to FINALLY FINISH THIS COOKBOOK is half watching bad tv. Tyler just put on the movie "Daddy's Home 2". Which gets a 19% on Rotten Tomatoes, so you now it's going to be good.
