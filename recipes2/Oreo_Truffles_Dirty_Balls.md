I did not give them the name, so don't blame me. I think these actually originally came from Ty's mom. 

- 1 pack Oreos
- 1 pack cream cheese, softened
- Coatings of your choice (optional) - melted chocolate,- sprinkles, chopped nuts, etc

Pulverize one pack of oreos in a food processor. (Kids love helping with this step.) After the cookies are totally crumbled, add the entire pack of softened cream cheese and blend well. The mixture will be thick, yet soft. Put it in the fridge until it is firm enough to roll into balls. 

Once you form the ball you can then roll it in the coatings of your choice. Or just eat them as is. Personally I like to melt some chocolate chips and dip the balls in the melted chocolate (and then place on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet, top with some sprinkles, and let cool). Store in the refrigerator.

Uh oh... between [page 248](Softer_Chocolate_Crinkles.md) and this one the baby has started making noises on the monitor... cross your fingers that she stays asleep... because if she wakes up, then you're back to the beginning (page 21) entertaining an adorable but overtired baby. And the cookbook STILL isn't finished. I hope you've enjoyed this little peek into #Beckysglamorouslife. Merry Christmas!! The end (of the brief memoir. Not the cookbook. The How Tos are not to be missed. So don't skip that section!)
