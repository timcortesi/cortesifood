don't recommend actually trying to make it (although I'm bet Tim and Max try anyway.) 

- 4 stories, containing:
- 1 nest of bees
- Wet and gooey mud
- 2 large stone
- 10 crickets
- 1 thorn bush
- 1 mouse
- Put all of the ingredients in a pot (unless you forgot to- close the door when you went out to gather the ingredients,- and the mouse went home, lit a fire, ate his supper, and- finished reading his book).
