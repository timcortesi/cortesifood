Mom made this for Dad for breakfast before he started his crazy long Tuesday teaching day that doesn't end until 8:30pm. They both say it tastes great and Mom requests it be included in this book. Mom served it with scrambled eggs and sliced strawberries. 

- 1/2 pound bacon diced
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped onion (or more)
- 1/4 cup chopped green pepper (or more)- 1 16.3 oz. tube large refrigerator biscuits- 1/3 cup butter, melted

Preheat oven to 350. Cook bacon until crisp, and drain. Combine cooled bacon, cheese, onion and green pepper. Cut biscuits into quarters; add to bacon mixture. Stir in butter and toss to cost. Transfer to greased monkey bread / tube pan. Bake until browned, about 30 minutes. Cool 10 min before inverting onto a serving plate. Refrigerate leftovers.
