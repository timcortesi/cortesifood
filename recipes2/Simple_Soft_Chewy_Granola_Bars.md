These are really good if you have some extra time to make your own granola bars. You can use whatever dried fruit/nuts/chocolate etc you feel like. This recipe is from inspiredtaste.net. 

- 2 1/2 cups old fashioned rolled oats
- 1/2 cup whole almonds, coarsely chopped
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries, coarsely chopped
- 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons mini chocolate chips

Heat oven to 350. Line bottom and sides of a 8-inch or 9- inch square pan with aluminum foil. Then lightly oil or spray with cooking spray. 

Toast oats & nuts: Add oats and almonds to a small baking sheet then bake 5 minutes, stir and bake another 3 to 5 minutes until lightly toasted. Transfer to a large bowl. 

Combine butter, honey, brown sugar, vanilla extract and the salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until butter melts and the sugar completely dissolves. 

Pour butter mixture in to bowl with toasted oats and almonds. Mix well. Let cool about 5 minutes then add cranberries and a 1/4 cup of the mini chocolate chips. Stir to combine. (continued on next page)
(The chocolate chips will most likely melt a little. This is fine, they turn into glue and help to hold the bars together). 

Transfer oat mixture to lined pan then use a rubber spatula or damp finger tips to firmly press the mixture into the pan. (Press hard here, this way the bars will stay together once cooled and cut - We press for about one minute to be extra safe). 

Scatter remaining 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips over pressed granola mixture then use a rubber spatula to gently press them into the top. Cover then refrigerate at least 2 hours. Remove block of granola mixture from pan then peel away aluminum foil. Cut into 12 bars. 

Store bars in an airtight container for up to one week. For the softest bars, keep at room temperature. For slightly harder bars, store in the fridge.
