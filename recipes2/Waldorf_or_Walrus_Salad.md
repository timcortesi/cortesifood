This is called Walrus Salad in the kids cookbook we grew up using. I think there is a picture of a walrus itself doing the cooking. Anyway I wasn't going to include it but we just went to the farm last weekend and I have about 500 apples to do something with so I figured hey, maybe I could make this. 

- 2 large red apples- Lemon juice
- 2 stalks celery
- 1/2 cup walnuts
- 1/4 cup mayo or yogurt- 1/2 cup raisins

Wash, core, slice, and dice the apples. Sprinkle with lemon juice so they won't turn brown (or use Cortland apples!). Then wash the celery and cut the leaves and thick ends off and chop the rest into little bite-sized pieces. You can chop up the shelled walnuts with a knife, or the kids' cookbook advises you can put them into a paper bag and walk on them (but that seems pretty weird). Once the walnuts are crushed or chopped, put them along with the mayonnaise or yogurt as well as the apples and raisins into a big enough bowl and mix up. Serve and eat! Refrigerate any leftovers.
