Mom and Dad made this with the Coconut Ginger Dal and Raita recipes also in this book (see pages 172 and 173). They highly recommend it ("tastes and smells like the Sitar ... really flavorful!") and served it with basmati rice and naan bread. Mom says you're just supposed to say naan and not naan bread. I say naan bread anyway. 

- 2 teaspoons turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 tablespoons cumin
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon
- 4 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 large white onion, chopped
- 7-8 large garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
- 1 (2") piece of ginger, peeled and grated or minced
- 3 pounds stew lamb meat (Mom used ground lamb- (you can also use beef or chicken chunks)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups crushed tomatoes
- 2-3 cups water
- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk (or milk stirred with 1- tablespoon white vinegar)
- Chopped cilantro, to taste

Place a large pot over medium heat. Add all the spices and stir, until very fragrant, 1 minute. Carefully pour in the oil, then add the onion, garlic and ginger and cook until soft but not browned. Season the lamb with salt and add to the pot with the tomatoes and water. 

(continued on next page)
Turn up the heat, bringing to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 1 hour, uncovered, or until lamb is very tender. Turn off the heat and allow to cool a bit. 

To add the buttermilk, pour it into a large bowl and stir (with a whisk) in a cupful of the warm curry liquid (doing it this way prevents the buttermilk from curdling in the hot liquid). Slowly add the buttermilk-curry mixture into the lamb (again, using a whisk). Stir the cilantro in and serve hot with basmati rice. 

(Note: Mom allowed it to simmer for about 2 hrs, uncovered, stirring occasionally, to thicken the liquid) 

Serves 6. 

P.S. I'm not sure why Dad is willing to eat lamb but not goat. If you want to see a goat, turn the page.
