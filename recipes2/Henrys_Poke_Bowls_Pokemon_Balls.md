Poke (pronounced POH-keh), if you haven't had it, is diced and marinated raw fish (usually tuna), usually served in a bowl over rice with vegetables and other stuff. It is kind of like a deconstructed bowl of sushi only this comes from Hawaii instead of Japan. (So if you make it for Dad, you can tell him he is still eating American food.) If you like sushi, you'll like this too. Henry loves both sushi and Pokemon, so for him we made "Poke(mon) Balls" with the red tuna, black dried seaweed, and white rice used to form the red, black, and white poke-ball shape. Serves 4. 

- 1 pound sushi grade ahi tuna (and/or you can try this with- salmon, but we like tuna better), cut into 1/2" cubes- **Make sure you get sushi grade tuna - it will be- labeled as such - not just any random tuna. Sushi- tuna is specially frozen to a certain temperature to- make sure all weird parasites are killed.
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/3 cup green onions
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds , plus more for garnish
- 2 cups cooked rice (white or brown)
- 2 cups salad greens
- Other toppings as desired: shaved carrots, cucumbers,
- avocado, pickled ginger, dried seaweed, sesame seeds

Combine tuna, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, green onions, and sesame seeds. Refrigerate covered for up to 2 hours. Toss to recombine in the sauce. Layer prettily in bowl: rice, greens, tuna, other toppings.
