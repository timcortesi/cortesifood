Rachel keeps telling me to make these but I haven't yet. Don't tell her or she will be grumpy. Something about she made them for Tim and even he ate them and said they were good even though they have chickpeas in them...? I don't know, I don't actually always fully listen to Rachel. 

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (15 ounce) can unsalted chickpeas, rinsed and drained- 3 tablespoons tahini
- 2 tablespoons 2% reduced-fat milk
- 1.3 ounces white whole-wheat flour (about 1/3 cup)- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 kosher salt
- 1/3 chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 350. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until light brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer butter to a bowl; cool 15 minutes. Whisk in brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla. 

Place chickpeas, tahini, and milk in a food processor; process until smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape sides of bowl. Stir chickpea mixture into butter mixture. 

Pour batter into an 8" square pan coated with cooking spray. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 25-27 minutes. Cool in pan 15 minutes. Slice into 12 bars.
