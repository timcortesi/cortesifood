These are the cookie cutter cookies with the lemon icing that are really good.

Cookies:
*1/2 lb. margarine (2 sticks)(1 cup)
*1 cup sugar
*3 eggs
*1 teaspoon vanilla
*3/4 teaspoon baking powder
*4 cups flour (add more if sticky)

Icing:
*2 cups confectioner sugar
*1/4 tsp lemon extract
*1/4 cup lemon juice (stirred in 1 tablespoon at a time)

Make cookies:
Cream together margarine and sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla, mix.  Add baking powder and mix.  Slowly add flour while mixing.  Refrigerate.  Roll out cookie dough 1/8-1/4&quot; thick (using flour to keep dough from sticking) and cut out cookies.  Bake cookies at 375 degrees for about 6-8 minutes - do not over bake.  Cool cookies completely before icing.

Make icing:
Combine all icing ingredients and add more sugar / lemon juice until desired consistency and flavor are achieved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="651">This fruit salad recipe comes from a friend of mine at work, and it is excellent.  You can make it for a picnic and eat the leftovers for breakfast.

*Small watermelon
*Red grapes
*Nectarines
*Blueberries

(The exact quantities of the fruit can vary depending on what you want your fruit salad to taste like.  You can also of course add any other fruit you want, but I happen to like this particular mixture.)

Ball watermelon, remove grapes from branches, chop nectarines, and rinse blueberries and remove any stems.  Mix all ingredients in bowl, and serve.

This recipe is for a frozen drink that you can make ahead and then keep in the freezer.  It is excellent.

*1/2 can (6 oz.) frozen lemonade
*1/2 can (6 oz.) frozen orange juice
*6 cups water
*2 cups tea (i.e. make hot tea using 2 teabags and 2 cups of hot water)
*2 cups sugar
*1 1/2 cups whiskey

Combine and freeze in tupperware container, stirring occasionally.  This will take about 24 hours to set, so make sure you give yourself enough time.

Suggestions: Pour in the lemonade &amp; orange juice first, and then add the hot tea so they cancel each other out.  It is also easier to stir in the sugar if you do it after you already put the tea in.  Make sure you use a large enough container.  Seagrams Whiskey works well for this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">This recipe is originally from Cooking Light September 2014, but we made some modifications.  Here is a [http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/apple-streusel-muffins-maple-50400000136987/ link to original recipe on Cooking Light's website].  When Mom made it she used extra apples and more streusel for the topping.


Streusel:
*4 tablespoons old-fashioned rolled oats
*4 tablespoons flour
*2 tablespoons brown sugar
*2 tablespoons butter, melted
*1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Muffins:
*1 cup flour
*1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
*2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
*1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
*1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
*3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk &lt;-- If you don't have buttermilk you can mix 3/4 cup milk with 3/4s of a tablespoon of either lemon juice or vinegar, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using.
*1/2 cup brown sugar
*2 tablespoons canola oil
*1 tablespoon butter, melted
*1 large egg, lightly beaten
*2 Gala apples, diced (about 2 cups)
*1/2 cup powdered sugar
*2 tablespoons maple syrup
*1/2 teaspoon water

Preheat oven to 400°.  Prepare streusel by combining ingredients in a bowl; set aside.  To prepare muffins, combine flours, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.  Combine buttermilk, 1/2 cup sugar, oil, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and egg in a bowl. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until combined. Fold in apple. Divide batter among 12 paper-lined muffin cups; top evenly with streusel. Bake at 400° for 16 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging. Cool in pan 5 minutes. Remove from pan; cool completely.  Combine powdered sugar, syrup, and 1/2 teaspoon water in a bowl; stir until smooth. Drizzle evenly over muffins.

Excellent fresh or frozen!

*1/2 bushel apples (preferably a mix of varieties (MacIntosh, Cortland, Yellow Delicious, etc)
*Approx. 1/2 cup apple juice/cider
*Approx. 1 teaspoon cinnamon

If you have a food mill:
Core and slice the apples and put into large pots with just enough apple juice to keep apples from sticking to the bottom as they begin to cook.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally from the bottom.  Apples are done when they are mushy and bubbling.  Remove from heat.  Put large spoonfuls of the hot cooked apples into the food mill (over large bowl), and turn handle to separate skins from apple pulp.  Empty practically dry skins from the food mill periodically.  Stir cinnamon into sauce to taste.

If you don't have a food mill:
Peel apples before coring and slicing apples as above.  Put into large pots with apple juice and cook and stir as above.  When apples are mushy, remove pot from heat and stir in cinnamon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1387">Rachel makes this and it is good.  Tim - there is no meat in this recipe so you will want to add chicken.

*1 package (3.75 oz.) cellophane (bean thread) or thin rice noodles (from the Asian food aisle at the store)
*1 tablespoon olive oil 
*8 oz. shiitake or other mushrooms, stems discarded and caps thinly sliced 
*6 cups vegetable or low-sodium chicken broth 
*2/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce 
*2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger 
*1 teaspoon chili or hot pepper sauce to taste (optional) 
*4 whole scallions thinly sliced 
*4 carrots, thinly sliced 
*8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces

Prepare the noodles according to the package directions.  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the broth, soy sauce, ginger, and chili sauce (if using) and combine. Bring to a boil. Add the scallions, carrots, and green beans. Simmer until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes.

Drain the noodles and cut into 3-inch lengths.  Divide among individual bowls and ladle the soup over the top.

Makes 4 servings.

Tip: If you prefer a more substantial soup, substitute 8 ounces of angel-hair pasta or whole-wheat spaghetti, breaking the strands into pieces before cooking.

*8 oz. sour cream
*2 pkgs. (each 8 oz.) cream cheese

Aunt Pat makes the batter for these muffins ahead of time, and then keeps it up to six weeks in the refrigerator.  This makes it easy to make warm muffins for unexpected guests.

*1 box (15 oz.) raisin bran cereal
*3 cups sugar
*5 cups flour
*5 teaspoons baking soda
*1 teaspoon salt
*4 eggs
*1 cup melted margarine
*1 quart buttermilk

Mix cereal, sugar, flour, baking soda and salt in large bowl.  Add beaten eggs, margarine and buttermilk.  Mix together.  Let sit overnight so moisture can be absorbed into the flakes.  Spoon out desired amount into greased cupcake cups and cook at 400 degrees for 20 minutes for large muffins, or 15 minutes for little muffins.  Store remaining batter in covered container in refrigerator for up to 6 weeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1209">[[Image:finney.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Aunt Ruth Finney's Sugar Cookies]]Mom remembers Aunt Ruth making these cookies (with pink frosting for Valentine's Day) when Mom visited Ohio when she was 16.  Mom later got the recipe from her to make when Becky was 3.  It is a good recipe to use when you want to make cookies with cookie cutters.

*1 cup sugar
*1 cup margarine/butter
*2 eggs
*5 tablespoons sour cream
*1 teaspoon vanilla
*4 cups flour
*1 teaspoon baking soda
*2 teaspoons baking powder
*Dash of salt

*Frosting (butter cream or canned)

In large mixing bowl, combine first five ingredients; beat until creamy. In separate bowl, combine remaining (dry) ingredients, and then add to first mixture. Chill dough overnight. Dough will be sticky, so only remove 1/4 of it at a time from the refrigerator, and place on lightly floured surface (Do not use powdered sugar).  Roll 1/4 inch thick and cut into shapes. Bake on greased cookie sheets at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes. Do not over-bake! Cookies should be lightly browned on bottom and white on top. Cool on racks and frost.

Note: Dough can be kept in refrigerator for several days or frozen for 2 months.

Very excellent (and I don't even like molasses).  Rachel eats these by the dozen.

*3/4 cup soft margarine
*1 cup brown sugar
*1 egg
*1/4 cup molasses
*2 1/2 cups flour
*2 teaspoons baking soda
*1/4 teaspoon salt
*1/2 teaspoon cloves
*1 teaspoon cinnamon
*1 teaspoon ginger
*1 cup raisins
*Granulated sugar

Mix shortening, sugar, egg and molasses thoroughly.  Add dry ingredients.  Stir in raisins.  Chill, if desired.  Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll dough in 1 1/4&quot; balls.  Roll balls in sugar.  Put them 3&quot; apart on greased baking sheet, and bake 10-12 minutes.

Makes 4 dozen cookies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1030">[[Image:cabbage.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Aunt Wendy's Chinese Chicken Cabbage Salad]]Super good, tangy and healthy!  Great make-ahead for a cool summer dinner.


*1 head of green cabbage
*1 1/2 lbs. boneless chicken breasts (4 1/2 breasts)
*3 pkgs. top ramen chicken flavor noodle soup
*1 pkg. (3.75 oz) salted sunflower seeds
*1 pkg. (2 oz) slivered almonds
*3 scallions
*1 cup red or white wine vinegar (or champagne)
*1/2 cup sugar
*3/4 cup sesame oil


Cut up/shred cabbage and slice scallions. Boil chicken breasts about 10 minutes, then dice. Put cabbage, scallions, and chicken in a large bowl (with lid). Fry sunflower seeds and almonds in a small amount of oil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and pat on paper towel until all dry. Pound packages of soup before opening, and remove all of the seasoning packets. Pour noodles in the salad. Mix sesame oil, vinegar, sugar and seasoning packets. Pour on salad immediately and mix well. Best to make a day ahead.

*1 large can baked beans
*6 hot dogs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour baked beans into 9&quot; x 9&quot; glass baking dish, and place hot dogs on top of beans.  Heat in oven until beans are bubbly (maybe 15-20 minutes).  Serve with sauerkraut, and hot dog rolls or zucchini bread, if desired.

Its a REALLY good recipe (really)!

*6 large ripe tomatoes
*1 can cream of celery soup
*Salt and pepper to taste
*1 onion, chopped
*1/2 green pepper, chopped
*1 stalk celery, chopped
*2/3 cup bread crumbs or (cooked) rice
*1/2 lb. ground beef, browned (optional)
*Parmesan cheese

Cut slices from stem ends of tomatoes, scoop out centers and save for stuffing. Pour soup into a 9&quot; x 9&quot; baking dish; set tomatoes in soup. Sprinkle tomato cavities with salt and pepper.

Prepare stuffing: Cook chopped onion, green pepper, and celery in the margarine for 5 minutes, or until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in chopped tomato centers. Add bread crumbs/cooked rice and optional ground beef.

Stuff tomato shells with stuffing, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.

Serve with white rice, a salad, and warmed Tuscan bread.

Serves 5 - 6.

For variation, try other vegetables as stuffing or additions to the stuffing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="875">Those of you who have come to visit me in Virginia will know that this is an excellent appetizer served at the Bonefish Grill.  Mom loved it so much that she got our waiter to write down the recipe.  Note that the instructions he gave us for the sauce will make a ton of sauce, so don't actually make that much.  Mom has the label from the chili sauce to show anyone who wants to see what it looks like.

Sauce:
*1 gallon mayo
*3 cups garlic chili sauce
*1/2 cup lemon juice
*1 cup Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce
*1/2 cup white vinegar

Other stuff:
*Shrimp
*Lettuce

To make sauce: Mix all ingredients together; makes 6 quarts.

To make shrimp: Deep fry shrimp first, then toss in sauce.  Use about 7 oz. of shrimp with about 2 oz. of sauce, for one serving.  Serve on a bed of lettuce.

He shared that the history of this dish is that a sea captain named Wenberg brought the recipe back from South America and presented it to the chef at Delmonico's in NYC. The chef named it after him Lobster Wenberg. When the sea captain started a fist fight in the dining room and was banned from Delmonico's, they changed the name to Lobster Newberg. At least that's the legend !

Make roux:  Melt butter; add flour and seasonings; whisk well.  Whisk into seafood mixture to thicken to desired consistency. Garnish with a few shakes of paprika, and parsley.  Serve hot over rice or pasta, or in puff pastry rounds.  Note: you can add more seafood if you want: lobster, clams, mussels, fish (cod, haddock, etc.) adjust the seasonings to your own taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1508">[[Image:Chowder.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Canoe Island Lodge Corn Chowder]]This is the recipe that the chef from CIL gave us.  Mom loved it! I have no idea what &quot;roux&quot; is or how exactly to make it, so you probably should look it up on Wikipedia.

*8 oz. (1/2 lb.) raw bacon
*1 medium onion, diced 1/8&quot;
*3 stalks celery, diced 1/8&quot;
*4 cups fresh cooked corn, cut from the cob
*6 cups chicken or corn stock (for corn stock, boil corncobs for 2 hours and strain)
*1 teaspoon dry thyme
*1 teaspoon garlic powder
*1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
*1 cup heavy cream
*4 medium potatoes, peeled (or unpeeled red potatoes)and diced 1/4&quot; 

*Roux (thickening agent): 
*2 Tbl margarine
*2 Tbl flour
*1-2 Tbl milk
*3/4 tsp salt
*1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper

In heavy bottomed stockpot (or Dutch oven), saute bacon until crisp. Remove bacon from pan and crumble btwn paper towels into small pieces.  Add onions and celery to the bacon fat in the pan, and saute until onions are translucent.  Add corn and stock and bring to boil.  Lower heat to a simmer and add seasonings.  Simmer for 15-20 minutes.  Add potatoes and simmer until just soft (abt 15-20 min more).  Add cream, return to simmer.  Make roux: in sm. saucepan over med heat, melt margarine.  Whisk in flour and add enough milk to make a creamy but thick mixture. Whisk the roux into the soup while simmering.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

These are okay if you like nuts, which I don't.  Other people who do like nuts seem to like them.

*2 1/2 cups of flour
*1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
*1 cup (2 sticks) margarine
*3/4 cup of packed brown sugar
*1 teaspoon vanilla
*1/3 cup fine chopped pecans
*1/2 lb. caramels
*1/4 cup water
*Additional chopped pecans (for topping)

Sift together flour and baking powder.  Melt butter over low heat, remove from heat, and stir in brown sugar, vanilla, and pecans.  Add dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Shape dough into balls using rounded teaspoonful for each.  Flatten one side by pressing on ungreased cookie sheet.  Pinch top point to resemble an acorn.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes until golden brown.  Cool.  Melt caramels and water over double boiler, (or substitute a 16 oz tub of caramel apple dip, warmed in the microwave for 1 1/2 min, stirring every 30 sec).  Dip flat ends of cookies into caramel mixture about 1/4&quot; deep.  Then dip into pecans.  Set on waxed paper to &quot;dry&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">[[Image:chili.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Chad and Lara's Mexican Chili]]Really good!  A nice alternative to traditional chili.  Kinda' expensive ingredients, though.

Sausage:
*1 1/2 tablespoons paprika
*2 tablespoons minced garlic (abt 5 garlic cloves)
*3 tablespoons dry red wine
*2 tablespoons sherry or red wine vinegar
*1 teaspoon, rounded, ground cumin
*1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
*1/2 teaspoon, rounded, ground coriander
*1/2 teaspoon black pepper
*Dash of salt
*3/4 pound lean ground pork
*3/4 pound ground turkey breast

Chili:
*2 tablespoons olive oil
*2 cups diced onion (about 2 medium)
*1 tablespoon ground cumin
*1 tablespoon finely minced garlic (abt 3 garlic cloves)
*2 teaspoons dried oregano
*1 1/2 chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, minced (from 7 oz can) 
*4 cans (15 oz.) black beans, rinsed and drained
*3 cups chicken broth (2 14.5 oz cans)
*1-1 1/2 cups water
*2 (14.5 oz.) cans unsalted diced tomatoes
*1/4 cup lime juice
*1/4 cup very finely chopped cilantro
*Low-fat sour cream (optional)
*Sliced green onions (optional)
*Shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

To prepare sausage, combine all ingredients in a large bowl.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

To prepare chili, heat oil in a large (6 qt.) pot over medium-high heat.  Add sausage mixture; cook abt 7 minutes or until browned, stirring to crumble.  Add onion, cumin, garlic, oregano, and chilies; cook abt 4 minutes or until onion is tender.  (Note:  you can freeze the remaining 8-10 chilies from the can in individual spots in an ice cube tray (and when frozen, put in zip lock bag) for future use) 

Place 1 1/2 cups black beans and 1 cup broth in a food processor; process until smooth.  Add pureed beans, remaining beans, remaining 2 cups broth, water, and tomatoes to pot with sausage mixture; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, 45 minutes or until slightly thick.  Stir in lime juice and cilantro.

Ladle chili into bowls.  Garnish each serving with sour cream, sliced green onions, and/or cheddar cheese, if desired.

Boil and stir 1 minute.  Stir in chicken and frozen vegetables.  Remove from heat.  Set aside.

Make Celery Seed Pastry: Cut mrgarine/butter into flour, celery seed and salt, until particles are size of small peas.

*1 container (8 oz.) frozen whipped topping, thawed
*1 can (21 oz.) cherry pie filling

Very good cookies (except the nuts).

*1 3/4 cups finely chopped pecans, divided
*1/3 cup sugar
*1 package (18 3/4 oz.) German chocolate cake mix with pudding
*1/2 cup vegetable oil
*2 large eggs, beaten
*6 oz. semisweet chocolate chips (1 cup)
*1 1/2 teaspoons hot water
*70 pecan halves

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Have baking sheets ready.  Combine 3/4 cup chopped pecans and sugar.  To make cookies, place cake mix in a large bowl.  Use mixer to beat in oil and eggs.  Add chocolate chips and remaining 1 cup pecan pieces.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2&quot; apart onto baking sheets.  Flatten each cookie lightly with the bottom of a juice glass dipped in the sugar and nut mixture.  Add hot water to the remaining sugar-nut mixture.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the sugar-nut topping over each cookie.  Firmly press a pecan half in the center of each.  Bake 8-10 minutes until top is set.  Remove to wire racks to cool.

*Corned Beef (comes with seasoning packet)
*4-6 potatoes
*3-4 peeled carrots
*1/2 head of cabbage, cored


Put the corned beef in a Dutch oven (6 qt. pot), cover with water, add the seasoning packet, and boil per package instructions.  One hour before the end of the suggested cooking time, cut up potatoes and carrots into 1&quot; chunks, and put into the pot.  Cut cabbage into wedges (after coring), and put into pot on top of everything else.  Make sure to add enough water to barely cover the vegetables.  When done, remove contents of pot with slotted spoon onto platter.

*2 slices bread
*1 jar peanut butter
*1 jar jelly
*1 dill pickle spear
* fritos

Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread, and jelly on the other.  Sprinkle jelly side with fritos.  Cut the dill pickle into 5 large chunks and put them on the bread slice spread with peanut butter.  For the top of the sandwich, slam the 2 slices together.  You will know that it is well made if the large pickle chunks are almost poking through the top of the bread.

Serve with some dog food.

Dad's Version:

*2 slices bread
*1 jar peanut butter
*1 jar jelly

Put the two slices of bread on a plate, and serve.  Note: the bread should not have any peanut butter or jelly spread on it.  If the person you are serving the sandwich to tries to ask why the sandwich doesn't have anything on it, tell them not to argue with you and send them to their room.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1509">[[Image:chick peas.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Crispy Chickpeas, Chicken, and Pita]]This recipe is from Real Simple and Rachel and I really love it.  It didn't have any meat in the recipe, so we added chicken for Tim.

*3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 
*2 15.5-ounce cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained 
*3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
*1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped, plus 1/2 cup whole parsley leaves 
*3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided 
*1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided 
*4 plum tomatoes, diced 
*4 pitas or pieces flat bread, warmed 
*1 8-ounce container hummus
*2 chicken breasts, cooked and sliced, (optional)
*1 small red onion, thinly sliced 
*1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco)
*1/2 cup plain yogurt 
*1 lemon, cut into wedges 

Chickpea mixture:
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chickpeas and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add the lemon juice, chopped parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper and toss with the chickpeas.  
Parsley Salad:
In a small bowl, combine the whole parsley leaves, tomatoes, and the remaining oil, salt, and pepper.
Assemble:
Divide the warm pitas or flat bread among individual plates and spread with the hummus. Top with the chickpeas, chicken (optional), onion, and hot sauce. Serve with the parsley salad, dollop of yogurt, and lemon wedges.

Serves 4.

This is good for making a temporary crystal sculpture that looks like broccoli/coral; ask Mom about it.  Do not eat it.  (Rachel and Pita, this means you!)

*6 tablespoons salt
*6 tablespoons blueing (chemical in sm plastic bottle - look in laundry detergent section of store)
*6 tablespoons water
*1 tablespoon ammonia
*A few drops of assorted food coloring

Combine all ingredients well.  Arrange pieces of broken bricks* in bowl*, and pour about 1/2 of the salt mixture evenly over the bricks.  (Reserve the remaining mixture in a tightly sealed jar).  Put a dot of different colors of food coloring on the edges and tops of different bricks.  Place in location where it won't be disturbed and wait for the crystals to grow/bloom.  Reserved solution can be added at the base occasionally (after a week?) to keep the crystals growing.  You can also add additional drops of food coloring at growth sites.  The Crystal Garden will have the appearance of coral and will be soft and powdery (and fragile!).  It will keep growing even after all the liquid has evaporated.

*Note: can substitute 6 charcoal briquettes or any other porous material (sponges, etc) for the brick pieces; and an aluminum pie tin for the bowl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="932">[[Image:sausage.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Dad's Sausage and Peppers]]Call up Dad and complain if this doesn't taste right, because he says that he pretty much just makes up the recipe as he goes.  It's really good when he makes it, though.


*1 16 oz. package kielbasa or other sausage
*2-3 green peppers
*1 onion
*1/2 cup ketchup
*1/4 cup brown sugar
*1/4 cup mustard
*1/2 cup water
*1/2 cup barbeque sauce
*5 'torpedo' or Portuguese rolls


Cut meat in 1/4&quot; slices, and cut each slice in half.  Cut peppers and onions into large chunks.  Cook all ingredients in large frying pan and cook at medium heat for 15-20 minutes, until hot.  Slice rolls sideways, lengthwise, and use a fork to remove some of the soft bread from the center.  Set aside.  Put a couple large spoonfuls of the sausage mixture on one side of roll - fold top over to make sandwich.  Serve with chips.


Serves about 5.

Probably this would taste better as chicken.  I don't actually love eggplant.

*2 lbs. (about 2 large) eggplants
*Salt to taste
*1 can (32 oz.) whole peeled tomatoes
*2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
*Olive oil
*Freshly ground black pepper
*1/2 cup all-purpose flour
*1/2 cup fine dry breadcrumbs
*7 large eggs, beaten
*1 1/2 lbs. mozzarella cheese, sliced into 1/4&quot; rounds
*1 cup grated high quality Parmesan cheese
*1 packed cup fresh basil leaves

Cut eggplants lengthwise into 1/4&quot; slices.  Arrange one layer in the bottom of a large colander and sprinkle evenly and generously with salt.  Repeat with remaining eggplant, salting, until all eggplant is in the colander.  Weigh down the slices with a couple of plates and let drain for 2 hours.  The purpose of this step is to have the eggplant release some of its moisture before cooking.  While the eggplant is draining, prepare tomato sauce.  Combine tomatoes, garlic, and 1/3 cup olive oil in a food processor.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.

When eggplant has drained, press down on it to remove excess water, and lay the slices out on paper towels to remove all the moisture.  In a wide, shallow bowl, combine flour and breadcrumbs.  Mix well.  Pour beaten eggs into another wide shallow bowl.  Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat, and pour in a half inch of olive oil.  When oil is simmering, dredge the eggplant slices first in the flour mixture, then in the beaten egg.  Working in batches, slide coated eggplant into hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides, turning once.  Drain on paper towels.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In the bottom of a 10x15&quot; glass baking dish, spread 1 cup of tomato sauce.  Top with one third of the eggplant slices.  Top eggplant with half of the mozzarella slices.  Sprinkle with one third of the Parmesan and half of the basil leaves.  Make a second layer of eggplant slices, topped by 1 cup of sauce, remaining mozzarella, half the remaining Parmesan, and all of the remaining basil.  Add remaining eggplant, and top with the remaining tomato sauce and Parmesan.

Bake until cheese has melted and the top is slightly brown, about 30 minutes.  Allow to rest at room temperature for about 10 minutes before serving.

Serves 8.

(For Stacy and Tim's Engagement Chicken, check out [http://cortesifood.com/wiki/Rachel%27s_Fiesta_Lime_Chicken Fiesta Lime Chicken]) Also, Andrew, this is the chicken that you really like.

*4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or 2 1/2 lbs skinless legs &amp; thighs)
*1 can cream of mushroom (or other, such as broccoli, celery, or chicken) soup
*White rice

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Put 4 chicken breasts into a square baking pan, and pour soup all over the top of the chicken.  Cook until done, about 1 hour.  Prepare rice (following package instructions) while chicken is cooking.  Serve; spoon sauce from chicken pan over rice.  Serve with broccoli or green beans and steamed apples.

Serves 4.

*3 cups of basmati brown rice
*1 large onion, cut angst grain into long, thin slices
*1 teaspoon red chili pepper powder
*1 teaspoon garam masala
*1 1/2 cups frozen peas
*Olive oil

Cover rice with water and let soak for approximately 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, saute onion in 2 tablespoon of oil in the bottom of a large pot.  Add 6 1/2 cups of water to the onions.  Also add red chili pepper powder, garam masala, and peas.  Drain water from the rice and add rice to onion/spice/pea mixture.  Put a lid on the pot and cook on low heat until the water is gone (approximately 20 minutes).

This is the really good salsa that we make in the salsa maker.  Rachel recommends using lime juice instead of lemon juice but I don't.  You can eat it alone or mix it with Velveeta cheese.

*2 medium ripe tomatoes (quartered)
*1/4 medium onion (quartered)
*4 springs cilantro (parsley)
*2 cloves of garlic
*1 teaspoon garlic salt
*2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice
*1 jalapeno (1/3 for mild, 2/3 for medium, all for hot and spicy)
*Velveeta cheese (optional)

Put all the ingredients (except cheese) in the Salsa Express (or food processor) and mix to consistency desired.  Serve with tortilla chips.

If desired, combine 1 lb. (16 oz.) Velveeta cheese (cut up) with 1 cup salsa and microwave for 3 minutes.  Stir, and microwave for another 2 minutes, or until cheese is melted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">This fruit leather takes a long long time to make (making it is easy, but cooking it takes forever), but it is a pretty neat thing to do once, if you have never done it.

*5 cups halved strawberries
*1/4 cup sugar

Place strawberries, 1 cup at a time, in blender.  Puree strawberries until smooth.  Stir in sugar.  Line two large cookie sheet with plastic wrap.  Secure edges with tape.  Spread fruit puree evenly in pans.

Place in 150 degree oven to dry.  Leave oven door ajar approximately 4&quot;.  Place candy thermometer in back of oven.  Check temperature periodically to be sure it is correct.  If necessary, turn oven off for a while to reduce temperature.  Rotate pans every 2 hours.  The leather is dry when the surface  is no longer sticky.  (Drying time is 6 to 12 hours.)

When dry, remove from oven.  Remove plastic wrap.  Let cool completely.  When cool, rewrap in plastic wrap by rolling up like a jelly roll.  Leathers can be stored at room temperature for 1 month; in refrigerator for 3 months and in freezer for 1 year.  Makes 2 leathers.

*1 box (the largest one) of Fruit Loops (or equivalent)
*1 box (the largest one) of Lucky Charms (or equivalent)
*2 lbs. plain M&amp;M's (assorted kinds - dark chocolate, mint, etc)
*1 lb. peanut M&amp;M's
*1 lb. peanut butter and/or crispy M&amp;M's
*1 can (12 oz.) honey roasted peanuts
*1 1/2 cups raisins (and/or craisins)
*1 jar unsalted sunflower seeds


Mix all ingredients together in large bowl and serve in plastic cups.  The best way to eat this is to pick out all the good stuff and then give Mom the leftover bad stuff like peanuts, raisins, and sunflower seeds.

*1 1/2 lbs. pork tenderloin
*3 cloves garlic
*1 package fresh rosemary
*1 teaspoon salt
*1 teaspoon pepper
*2 Tbl olive oil
*1 cup (8 oz) white wine
*1 cup (8 oz) chicken broth


Peel garlic and slice into paper thin slivers.  Cut deep slits all over the pork and insert a sliver into each.  Remove needles from 4 sprigs rosemary and chop needles as finely as possible.  Mix chopped rosemary with salt and pepper, and rub rosemary mix all over pork.  Heat oil in large frying pan, and add pork.  Cook until brown on each side.  Remove pork from heat to baking dish, and add wine and chicken broth.  Cover pan with foil and bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Let meat sit for 5 minutes after removing from oven.  Slice and serve.


Suggested side dishes: Pesto Baked Tomatoes, couscous, and sliced baguette.

*1 lb. dried navy or pea beans
*Ham hocks
*Onion, cut up
*Carrots, cut up
*Tomato (if desired)

Soak beans overnight.  Cook next morning with ham hocks for about 1-2 hours.  Add onion, carrots, and tomato (if using).  Presumably then you cook it some more and then eat it.  Ask Mom for more details about this recipe because this is all she gave me.

(Okay, only the grandchildren actually don't like this.  I think everyone else does.)

*1 envelope unflavored gelatin
*1/4 cup maraschino cherry juice
*1 cup diced apricots
*1 cup diced pineapple (14 oz)
*1 cup halved, seeded grapes
*1 cup chopped maraschino cherries (12 oz jar)
*3 tablespoons lemon juice
*1/2 cup sugar
*1 cup heavy cream
*2 cups colored mini marshmallows
*1/2 cup mayonnaise


Soften gelatin in cherry juice in top of double boiler.  Dissolve over boiling water.  Add fruits, lemon juice, sugar and marshmallows.  Chill until syrupy (no more than 1/2 hr).

Whip cream until light and fluffy.  Stir in mayonnaise.  Fold into fruit mixture with a wooden spoon, using an over under motion.  Spoon salad into molds.  (Use empty margarine tubs, 6 oz. tupperware jello molds, etc.)  Store in freezer.

This is (a version of) the soup Grandmother always used to make for us while we were working making wreaths and selling Christmas trees in December.  If it doesn't taste exactly right, that is because  she didn't know all of the exact quantities.  She says to just experiment and it will be fine.

*1 lb. ground beef, browned
*1-2 onions, chopped
*1 quart canned or chopped tomatoes (28 oz. can)
*1 small bag frozen mixed vegetables
*3 carrots, cut up
*1 beef bouillon cube
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/2 teaspoon marjoram
*1 bay leaf
*1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
*1 tablespoon parsley
*1/4 teaspoon pepper
*1 can cream of mushroom soup or celery or broccoli or tomato soup
*2 cans water (use empty soup can for measuring)

In a large pot, brown the meat, then add the onions.  Cook until the onions are soft.  Add the rest of the ingredients, and simmer for 1-2 hours.  Serve with kaiser rolls (preferably from Joe Camera's Deli in Shrub Oak, NY, which is where Grandmother gets her rolls from), butter, Christmas music, fresh wreaths, and snow.

{{Disgusting}}

This is Mom's favorite snack, especially to have at slumber parties when she is trying to impress the cool kids in junior high.

*1 sleeve Saltines
*1 block Velveeta cheese
*1 bag large marshmallows

(You probably only actually need 1 cracker, 1 slice of cheese, and 1 marshmallow, because you only ever want to make this once.)

Place Saltines on a cookie sheet, in a single layer.  Slice Velveeta, and place one slice of cheese on each cracker.  Put 1 marshmallow on top of each cheese slice.  Cook the marguerites on the top rack of the oven (under the broiler) and WATCH until the cheese is melted and the marshmallow is browned.  Remove immediately, and serve.

*3 lbs. potatoes
*Flour
*1/2 stick butter
*Salt and pepper to taste

Peel and slice potatoes into 1 1/2&quot; - 2&quot; rounds, about 1/8&quot; thick.  Place 1 layer of  sliced potatoes in the bottom of a 9x9&quot; square glass pan.  Sprinkle lightly with flour, and dot with butter (about 1 tablespoon total).  Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Repeat to make 3 layers.

Rachel (who found this recipe) is being annoying right now and says &quot;mmm I have no idea&quot; when I ask her for details about this recipe.  Actually, it is really good - the cheddar and Worcestershire are good additions to the traditional campfire recipe.


*1 pound lean ground beef
*1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (4 ounces)
*1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
*6 medium green onions, 2 chopped (2 tablespoons) and 4 sliced (1/4 cup)
*1 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt, divided
*2 medium yellow Yukon potatoes, thinly sliced
*1 1/2 cups baby carrots (abt 16 - cut into 1/2&quot; pieces)
*12 cherry tomatoes, cut in half, (or 1 med tomato, diced) if desired


Heat coals or gas grill for direct heat.  Spray half of one side of four 18x12&quot; sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil with cooking spray.

Mix beef, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, 2 Tbl chopped onions, and 1 teaspoon seasoned salt.  Shape mixture into 4 patties, about 1 inch thick.  Place potatoes on sprayed sides of foil sheets.  Top with beef patty, carrots, tomatoes and sliced onions; sprinkle with 1/2 tsp seasoned salt.  Fold foil over patties and vegetables so edges meet.  Seal edges, making tight 1/2&quot; fold; fold again.  Allow space on sides for circulation and expansion.

Cover and grill packets 4-6&quot; from medium heat 20-30 minutes or until potatoes are tender, turning packets half way through.  Remove from heat; cut large X across top of packet; fold back foil.  CAUTION:  steam will escape - contents will be very hot!


Serves 4.

These are the carrots that I do not love.  Kristamarie used to eat them for me in exchange for me eating her mashed potatoes.

*2 lbs. carrots, julienned (cut into thin strips, 2&quot; long)
*2 cans (8 oz.) crushed pineapple
*1 tablespoon corn starch

Cook or steam carrots until done.  Mix pineapple and corn starch in saucepan, and heat to bubbling (stirring constantly).  Cook 2-3 minutes until clear.  Pour over carrots and serve, but not to Becky.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">The ingredient list and recipes for this menu were all mixed together, so I am leaving them that way.  Deal.

Buy: Indian grocery store stuff…
*Shan brand Shahi Haleem mix (comes in a cake-mix size box; contains a packet of grains, and a package of spices)
*Shan brand Meat Masala mix (medium spicy; smaller box – 100 g; contains a package of spices)
*ARZ Lebanese pitas (7” – 6 to a package (white, and thinner than our usual))
*4 or 5 small skinny green chile peppers (looks like thin, long jalapenos)
*3 Kareelay (looks like 5-6” long pickles with leprosy bumps all over them)
*Haldiram brand Khatta Mitha (neon green bag with trail-mix type stuff in it for snacking while you’re cooking – crunchy, sweet and sour -- VERY good)

Also need:
*2 1/2 cups brown basmati rice
*2 1/2 lbs. of boneless skinless chicken breast
*1 bulb garlic
*5 tomatoes
*10 onions
*2 teaspoons salt
*1 heaping teaspoon ground ginger
*1 egg, scrambled
*2  cups olive oil
*1 cup plain yogurt
*Lemon juice

Chicken Dish:

Cut the chicken up into 1-2” pieces, and cook it in a large pot with 3/4 cup olive oil.  Add 2 medium onions (cut into chunks), and almost 1 whole garlic bulb, separated into cloves (reserve 4 cloves for vegetable dish).  Cook together until onions are golden brown.  Add diced pieces of 2 chili peppers (approx 1 tablespoon) to the mixture along with approx 2/3 of the spice bag from the haleem mix box.  Cook and stir occasionally.

In a separate bowl, pour 2/3 of the grain bag from the haleem mix box into a bowl.  Cover with water and let soak for 10-15 minutes.  Drain.  Pour into chicken mixture.  Add 5 cups of water into the pot and set to simmer on medium heat, stirring occasionally for 2 hours.  Cut up 2 tomatoes into chunks, and add to chicken, stirring to break up the chicken into shreds.  Cook another 1-2 hours, adding more water as necessary – it should resemble a thick soup consistency, and the grain should not be chewy when done.

Garnish:

Cut an onion in half and slice in strips length-wise. Cook it in 1/4 cup olive oil until brown and crispy.  Remove the onions from oil, and pat dry on paper towel.  When serving the chicken, crumble the onions onto the chicken and sprinkle with a little lemon juice.

Brown Rice:

Put 2 1/2 cups brown rice in a bowl and cover with water – let soak 15 minutes.  Put 1/2 cup olive oil in a large pot, and add 1 onion (cut in half, then sliced into strips, length-wise).  Sauté until golden brown.  Drain the rice and add it to the pot along with 1 teaspoon salt, and
4 1/2 cups of water.  Bring it to a boil, and boil for about 2 minutes, then turn to low to simmer until all water has been absorbed.

Kareelay and Onion Vegetable dish:

Cut ends off kareelay, and peel/scrape the bumps off.  Slice them down the center, and take out the center white part (resembles a zucchini inside), and discard it.  Cut the remaining “rind” part into approx 3” length pieces, by 1” wide.  In a large pot, saute them in 1/2 cup olive oil until golden brown.  Cut 5-6 onions in half, and slice them into strips length-wise.  Add them to the pot with the kareelay, along with 4 whole garlic cloves.  Cook until the onions are translucent.  Add 3 tomatoes cut into 1” chunks, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2-diced long green chili peppers.  Add 3 teaspoons of the spices from the Meat Masala Mix box, and 1 heaping teaspoon of ground ginger.  Simmer for a couple hours, stirring occasionally, until its getting dry – like a paste consistency.  Add 1 egg, stir, and let simmer a little longer.  Serve on warmed pitas as below.

Pitas:

Warm pitas in the microwave, or individually in a buttered frying pan.

To assemble/eat:

Put a large serving of rice on a plate, and cover with a generous portion of the chicken mixture, garnished as above, if desired.

Put pita on a plate, and place approx ¼ cup vegetable dish in the center of the pita.  Put a dollop of plain yogurt off to the side of the pita.  Tear off a piece of the pita, and dip/scoop in the vegetable mixture, then dip it in the yogurt, and eat. 

Serves 8.

*1 cup margarine
*1 1/2 cups brown sugar, divided
*1 teaspoon vanilla
*2 eggs, separated
*1 tablespoon water
*2 cups flour
*1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*1 teaspoon baking powder
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*1/2 cup chopped nuts
*1 pkg. (12 oz.) chocolate chips

Cream margarine, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, vanilla, egg yolks, and water.  Next, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt, and add to creamed mixture.  Spread in greased 9 x 13&quot; pan.  Sprinkle with chopped nuts and chocolate chips.  Make a meringue topping with the remaining brown sugar (1 cup) and egg whites, whipped together at high speed until it turns an off white color - abt 2 min.  Very carefully spread the meringue on top of the chocolate chips.  Bake at 375 degrees for 25 - 30 minutes until meringue is light golden.

While pork is cooking, make sauce as follows.  Heat (stirring with a wire whisk) cream on medium heat until reduced (about 20 minutes, until thick).  Stir in wine, 1/4 cup mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and white pepper.  Cook for 2 - 3 more minutes, and serve over pork.

Serve with either mashed or roasted potatoes, steamed apples and green beans.  Use extra sauce as gravy over potatoes too.


Serves 4-5

Dad wrote down this recipe for me, so ask Mom if it isn't right.

*1 16 oz. box lasagna noodles
*24 oz. ricotta cheese (abt 3 cups)
*16 oz. part skim mozzarella cheese, sliced with cheese cutter
*Parmesan cheese
*Spaghetti sauce with hamburger meat

Boil noodles in large pot of water with 1 tsp oil added for 11 min.  Drain noodles.  Spoon enough sauce to thinly cover the bottom of a 9&quot; x 13&quot; pan.  Place 1st layer of noodles along bottom of pan, overlapping edges.  Put spoonfuls of ricotta cheese on top of noodles, and cover with pieces of mozzarella cheese.  (Use abt 1/3 of both cheeses per layer).  Add a layer of sauce to just cover the cheeses &amp; noodles, and gently smear around.  Repeat layering process to fill pan (3 layers).  The top of the lasagna should be a final layer of noodles covered with sauce (and you can use up any other cheese you have leftover, but make sure to spread it around evenly).  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top of the sauce.

Bake in 350 degree oven for approximately 45 minutes.  Serve with a green salad and Italian bread.
Freezes well.

Serves 6-8

I really like these cookies, but they are a bit tricky to make because the dough is always so sticky.

*2 3/4 cups flour (may need extra if sticky)
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/2 teaspoon baking powder
*1 1/2 cups sugar
*3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) margarine
*2 eggs
*1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
*1 tablespoon lemon juice
*1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
*6-7 drops yellow food color
*Empty thread spool

Mix flour, salt, and baking powder.  Beat 1 cup of the sugar and the margarine in a large bowl with electric mixer until fluffy.  Beat in eggs, lemon rind, lemon juice, lemon extract, and 3-4 drops yellow food color.  On low speed, gradually beat in flour mixture.  Chill 1 hour.

Heat oven to 400 degrees, and grease cookie sheets.  Stir together the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and 3 drops yellow food color until uniform.  Form dough into small balls the size of a small walnut.  Roll in colored sugar.  Place about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  Press flat (only a little larger than spool) with the bottom of a glass.  Press spool about halfway into each cookie center.  Bake 8 minutes or until a light golden color, and cool on wire racks.

Makes about 48 cookies.

*3 cups cooked chicken, cut up
*1 cup minute rice
*2/3 cup chopped celery
*2/3 cup chopped carrots
*1/4 cup chopped pimento (2 oz)
*1 tsp. salt
*1/4 tsp poultry seasoning (combo: sage, thyme, marjoram, black pepper, cloves)
*2 cups chicken broth
*4 eggs, well beaten
*2 cups broken soft bread

Gravy:
*1 can cream of mushroom or celery soup
*1/3 can milk


Cook minute rice according to package directions (can be cooked in the liquid from cooking the chicken).  Mix all ingredients (except gravy) together. Pour into greased 2 qt. baking dish.  Bake for 55 minutes at 350 degrees. Mixture will be rather thin but bakes thick. (If there isn't enough broth from cooking the chicken, use either canned broth or bouillon cubes. If using bouillon cubes, adjust the salt lower.) To make gravy, combine soup with milk using a wire whisk.  Heat in microwave.  When baked, cut into servings and serve with gravy, a green salad and dinner rolls.

Serves 6-8

*1 cup roasted corn tomato salsa
*1 can (4 oz.) diced green chilies

The Andes mints melted on top of these brownies make them taste great!

*1 box brownie mix
*1 box (4.6 oz) Andes mints (28 pieces) OR
*1 box (5 oz) Necco mints

Prepare brownie mix as directed on box.  Spread in greased 9x13&quot; pan, and bake brownies 5 minutes less than directed in box instructions.  Remove brownies from oven and evenly distribute mints on top.  Return to oven, bake for remaining 5 minutes, and quickly spread melted mint chocolate (while still warm) to evenly distribute across the top of the brownies.  Let brownies cool and serve with a glass of cold milk.

Good for picnics and summer dinners.

*6 eggs
*Water
*1/3 cup mayo
*1 1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar
*Paprika

Hard boil eggs: gently place eggs directly from refrigerator into saucepan and cover with cold water.  Cover, put pan on medium high heat, and bring to a boil.  As soon as the water boils, turn heat down to low, and simmer for 11 minutes.  When eggs are done, immediately pour out hot water and run cold water over eggs constantly until eggs are cool.  (Mark with a pencil to distinguish from non-cooked eggs in the refrigerator if not using all of them).  Note - it is best to not use fresh eggs, as fresh eggs are harder to peel.
Gently tap hardboiled eggs on counter to crack shell; remove shell and rinse eggs.  Cut eggs in half lengthwise, and remove all yolks into small mixing bowl.  Set aside egg whites.  Mix yolks with mayo and vinegar.  Spoon small amounts of yolk mixture back into egg whites; sprinkle all with paprika.

Serves 6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1740">[[Image:Beef gravy.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Beef Gravy]]
These are instructions for how to make gravy to go along with your meat dinner.

*Drippings from pan you cooked meat in
*Water
*Flour
*Gravy Master, if desired
*Salt and pepper to taste

Beef:
Put the roasting pan that contains the drippings, onions pieces, etc. from roast on a medium heat, and add some water (1/2 cup?) to help you scrape meat droppings off the sides and bottom of the pan.  Liquid should be simmering.  Meanwhile, in a shaker (or jar with a tight fitting lid), combine approximately 1/2 cup COLD water with about 3 tablespoons flour.  Put lid on and shake firmly until well combined.  While stirring constantly, slowly pour some of the flour/water mixture into the pan, causing the juices to thicken into gravy.  Keep pouring until the correct consistency is reached.  For a darker gravy stir in approximately 1/4+ teaspoon of Gravy Master (2 oz. jar of brown liquid with an orange label).  Salt and pepper to taste.

Poultry:
Simmer giblets (gizzard, heart, neck) in a saucepan (covered with water) for an hour or more.  Remove from water; dice and set aside.  Pour drippings from roasting pan into a clear measuring cup or wide mouth jar so that you can see the fat rise to the top.  Wait a couple minutes for that to happen, then ladle off the lightest (fat) layer and discard.  Pour remaining juices back into roasting pan and continue as above.  Additionally, add diced pieces of giblets.

Note - you can always make more of the thickening agent (flour and water), but be sure to use COLD water.  Also, its critical to stir constantly when adding the flour and water, or you'll have lumpy gravy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="722">[[Image:Meatballs.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Mom's Meatballs]]These are the regular meatballs that we usually have with spaghetti and spaghetti sauce.  You can freeze them if you would like.

*1 lb. ground beef (at least 85% lean)
*2 eggs
*2 slices wet bread
*1/4 cup parmesan cheese
*1 teaspoon parsley
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*Dash of pepper

Cake:
*Lemon cake mix (and any ingredients required for normal preparation)
*1 small box lime jello mix
*3/4 cup boiling water
*1/2 cold water

Topping (see note below):
*1 envelope Dream Whip
*1 small box lemon instant pudding mix
*1 1/2 cups cold milk


Prepare 9 x 13&quot; lemon cake normally, following box instructions.  Let cake cool completely in pan.

Fully dissolve lime jello mix in the boiling water, stirring 2 min. Add cold water and stir. Refrigerate until jello begins to thicken (just under 1 hour).  Whisk thoroughly.

Poke holes in cake 1&quot; apart and pour jello in holes.  Make sure each hole gets filled with jello by banging pan gently on counter, and redistributing jello on top of cake to fill holes.

To make topping:  Combine Dream Whip, lemon instant pudding mix, and milk. Beat for 3-8 minutes and refrigerate. Spread on cake before eating.


Note: Alternatively, if Dream Whip is unavailable (like if you move to Houston),to make the topping without Dream Whip, use 1 cup cold milk, 1 cup Cool Whip, and lemon instant pudding mix.

Also apparently this recipe is actually from Grandmother, and it is actually for making spare ribs, but we never did it that way.

*2 lbs. thick bone in, or boneless pork chops (6 chops)
*1 cup sliced onion
*1 cup ketchup
*1 cup water
*2 teaspoons salt
*1/4 cup cider vinegar
*1/4 cup brown sugar
*2 tablespoons Worcestershire
*2 teaspoons dry mustard
*1 teaspoon paprika

Remove all fat from pork chops, and place in 9&quot; square pan.  Combine remaining ingredients and pour over pork chops (goal is to cover meat with sauce).  Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours.

Serves 6 people.

Serve with white rice, steamed apples, and a green vegetable.

Note: pineapple chunks may be added to sauce.

This is the breakfast &quot;cake&quot; that you pull apart with your fingers to eat.  Andrew, the bundt pan is the weird looking pan with the hole in the middle of it.

*4 packages refrigerated buttermilk biscuits, divided
*1 cup sugar
*1 tablespoon cinnamon
*5 1/4 tablespoons margarine
*1/2 cup chopped pecans
*Raisins

Cut biscuits into quarters, 1 can at a time, and then roll each piece in mixture of sugar and cinnamon.  Grease the bundt pan and sprinkle some nuts and raisins in the bottom of the pan.  Cover the bottom with 1 pkg of cinnamon-sugar coated biscuit pieces, and then sprinkle in more nuts and raisins.  Continue layering biscuit pieces, (1 pkg per layer), nuts, and raisins until done.  Melt margarine and drizzle over cake.  Sprinkle any remaining sugar/cinnamon mixture over cake.  Bake at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes.  Invert immediately onto plate (be careful of hot syrup surrounding cake).  Cool and pull apart with fingers to serve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1318">Very good recipe for cooked pinto beans.

*1 lb. pkg. dried pinto beans (picked clean, rinsed, and soaked overnight)
*1 clove garlic, peeled, whole
*1 teaspoon salt (optional)
*6 oz. cold beer (non-alcoholic works too)
*4 strips bacon, sliced thin
*1 large onion, chopped
*1/2 bunch fresh cilantro - about 2 cups
*1 teaspoon cumin
*1 teaspoon oregano
*Pepper to taste

Drain beans from soaking water and cover by about 2&quot; with fresh, cold water.  Bring to a low boil, stirring occasionally - scoop out the froth.  At the same time heat a kettle of water to replenish the beans, as needed.  When reaching low boil, add salt only and lower heat to keep at simmer.  Usually about 2-3 hours.  After you lower the heat, add beer and just maintain water to cover the beans.  When you blow on beans in a spoon the skin will curl back when ready for next step.  In separate frying pan (cast iron is best) fry up chopped bacon with onion.  When onion is clear, add chopped cilantro.  Saute until bacon is crisp.  Add all, even bacon drippings, to beans.  Stir together bacon mix and beans over simmer for about 1/2 hour before adding seasonings.  Great if reheated.  Easy to mash down and add cheese and salsa for burritos or dipping.

This one is actually really good (unlike the spinach one!)


*2+ cups cut up fresh broccoli
*2 chicken breasts, par boiled, boned and cut up
*1 can cream of chicken/celery/broccoli/mushroom soup
*1/2 cup mayo
*1 tablespoon lemon juice
*4 slices American or cheddar cheese
*Approx. 1/4 cup bread crumbs


Layer broccoli and chicken in 8&quot; x 8&quot; pan.  Mix together soup, mayo, and lemon juice, and pour over top of the broccoli and chicken.  Layer cheese slices on top.  Sprinkle bread crumbs over cheese.  Bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Serve over rice.

Serves 4.

Rachel, remember when you wanted more zucchini bread and I told you that Mom wouldn't let you have any until you finished the rest of your dinner, and then you went and asked Mom if you could have more and she told you not until you finished your dinner, and then you were really grumpy?

*1/2 cup oil
*1 cup sugar
*2 eggs
*2 teaspoons vanilla
*1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*1/4 teaspoon baking powder
*1 1/2 cup flour
*1 cup chopped walnuts
*1 medium zucchini, shredded in food processor (about 1 1/2 cups)

Mix together all ingredients except flour, walnuts, and zucchini.  Slowly add flour, and then stir in nuts and zucchini.  Pour in greased 9&quot; x 5&quot; loaf pan (or 3 3 1/2&quot; x 5&quot; loaf pans).  Bake at 350 degrees.  (9x5 loaf for 1 hour and 15 minutes) or (3 smaller loaves for 40-45 minutes).

It makes brownies (from scratch) with chocolate chips in them.  Its REALLY good!


*3/4 cup all purpose flour
*1/4 teaspoon baking soda
*1/4 teaspoon salt
*1/3 cup butter
*3/4 cup sugar
*2 tablespoons water
*1 12 oz. pkg (2 cups) chocolate chips, divided
*1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*2 eggs
*1/2 cup chopped nuts
*1/4 cup mini M&amp;M's


Preheat oven to 325.  In small bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.  In small saucepan, combine butter, sugar and water; bring just to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Add 1 cup chocolate chips and vanilla extract.  Stir until chips melt and mixture is smooth.  Transfer to large bowl.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually blend in flour mixture.  Stir in remaining 1 cup chocolate chips and nuts.  Spread into greased 9&quot; square baking pan.  Sprinkle with M&amp;M's.  Bake at 325 degrees for 30-35 minutes.  Cool completely and cut into 16 squares.

This is the standard chocolate chip cookie recipe from the chocolate chip bag, but it makes really good cookies (and this is what we always used to make them when we were growing up), so I am putting it in this book.

*2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
*1 teaspoon baking soda
*1 teaspoon salt
*1 cup (2 sticks) butter/margarine, softened
*3/4 cup granulated white sugar
*3/4 cup packed brown sugar
*1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*2 eggs
*2 cups (12 oz. package) chocolate chips
*1 cup chopped walnuts

Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.  Beat butter/margarine, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla in large mixer bowl until creamy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition; gradually beat in flour mixture.  Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.  Drop by rounded tablespoon onto greased cookie sheets.

Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown.  Let stand for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Pan cookie variation:  Grease 9 x 13&quot; pan.  Spread batter in pan.  Bake at 375 for 25-30 min until golden brown, and center is set.  When completely cool, cut like brownies.

The most important part of this recipe is to make sure that you have the grown-up assistant.

*3 green onions (scallions)
*1 pound hamburger meat
*1 teaspoon garlic powder
*2 tablespoons mustard
*1/4 cup ketchup
*4 hamburger buns
*1 adult helper

Wash and chop the green onions (you don't need to chop the green part if you don't want).  Put the hamburger meat in the frying pan, add the chopped-up onions, and cook over low heat until brown.  Have your grown-up assistant come over to help spoon the fat into an empty jar or milk carton.  Add the other ingredients (except the hamburger buns), and simmer for a few minutes.  Spoon onto your hamburger buns and serve with seasoned curly fries, baby carrots and milk.

Serves 4.

Crust:
*2 cups flour
*2 cups oats
*1 1/2 cups brown sugar
*1 teaspoon baking soda
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*1 1/4 cups margarine

Filling:
*6 oz. package chocolate chips (1 cup)
*1/2 cup chopped nuts
*12 oz. jar caramel ice cream topping
*3 tablespoons flour

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9&quot; x 13&quot; pan. In large bowl, mix crust ingredients at low speed until crumbly. Press 1/2 mixture (about 3 cups) into pan (not easy, but SO worth it). Bake 12 minutes. Sprinkle warm base with chocolate chips and nuts. Combine caramel topping and 3 tablespoons flour, and drizzle over chocolate chips and nuts. Evenly distribute remaining 'crust' on top using flattened spoonfuls. Return to oven and bake 20-25 minutes, until golden.  Cool completely. Cut into bars.

Makes 36 bars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1275">Becky found this recipe on myrecipes.com - the original link is [http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/overnight-peaches-cream-french-toast-50400000116330/# here].  What is below is slightly modified (more peaches).  Also FYI if you only need to serve 4 you can can half the whole recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan.

*1 8-oz. loaf French bread, sliced
*8 large eggs
*2 cups whole milk
*1/4 cup sugar
*1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*40 oz. sliced peaches, drained if you are using canned peaches
*1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
*1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
*1/2 cup heavy cream


Put pam in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange bread in a tight, flat layer in dish.  In a large bowl, whisk eggs with milk, sugar and vanilla until blended; pour over bread. Arrange peaches on top and sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
Remove baking dish from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour cream into a small pan; bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Drizzle over peaches and bake, uncovered, until casserole is lightly browned on top and just cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Mom loves when you make these &quot;owls&quot; into aliens.

*1 1/2 squares (1 1/2 oz.) unsweetened chocolate
*1/4 teaspoon baking soda
*2 1/2 cups flour
*2 teaspoons of baking powder
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*3/4 cup margarine
*1 cup brown sugar
*1 egg
*1 teaspoon vanilla
*About 100 chocolate chips (for eyes)
*About 50 cashew nuts (for beaks)

Melt unsweetened chocolate (in microwave 2 min, stir; micro 30 sec, stir; micro 30 sec, stir) and let cool. Mix in baking soda and set aside.  Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt, and set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, cream margarine and brown sugar. Add egg and vanilla and beat well. Blend dry ingredients in gradually.  Remove 2/3 of dough to floured surface, and blend chocolate mixture with the remaining dough. Chill.  Roll out half of the light dough to a 10&quot; x 4 1/4&quot; strip. Shape half of chocolate dough into roll 10&quot; long. Place strip on light dough and mold light dough over dark. Wrap in aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining dough. Chill for at least two hours.  Cut into slices 1/8-1/4&quot; thick and place two slices together on greased cookie sheet to resemble an owl. Pinch corner of each slice to form ear. Put chocolate chips for eyes and cashew nut for a beak. Bake at 350 for 8-12 minutes.

*Whatever pancake / waffle ingredients are listed in the directions / box mix you are using
*Other stuff to add (fruit or chocolate chips), if desired

Follow the directions on any Bisquick box, pancake mix, etc (may need to adjust milk up a tablespoon or so, depending on mix for correct consistency, and add an egg), or the Betty Crocker cookbook (Mom's is page 197 - and she adds an extra tablespoon milk).  Add some finely chopped apple pieces to the batter, or blueberries or chocolate chips to individual pancakes immediately when the batter's on the griddle.  For pancakes, use abt 1/4 cup per pancake, and cook on very hot greased griddle; turn when bubbles pop.  
For waffles, spray Pam thoroughly on the waffle iron - top and bottom, EVERY time.  Use a little less than 1/4 cup per section of Belgian waffle maker, or barely enough to fill the waffle iron sections of a regular waffle iron (remember, it expands).  Cook until the light goes off on the machine, or the waffles are golden brown.  
Serve with maple flavored (not real maple) syrup warmed in the microwave in a glass container (not in the plastic bottle it comes in otherwise you get in trouble with Tyler about the plastic chemicals in your syrup).  If you do happen to want to warm it in the plastic bottle, open the spout first so the bottle doesn't explode while heating.

*6-8 peeled and sliced peaches (4-5 cups)
*1 cup sugar

*1 tablespoon sugar
*1/3 cup milk
*cinnamon sugar

Mix peaches, sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in saucepan.  Heat and boil gently until thickened.  Pour into oven-proof 9x9&quot; baking dish.  Prepare Bisquick with sugar and milk.  Spoon about 8-9 piles onto fruit.  Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.

Note: If you don't have any Bisquick, you can instead make the biscuits by cutting 3 tablespoons margarine into: 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Add 1/2 cup milk.  (Note that the quantities of sugar and milk are different from those listed above).

*2 (10-ounce) portions frozen pizza dough, thawed 
*4 tomatoes, thinly sliced
*2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
*1 cup shredded mozzarella
*1/2 cup thinly sliced basil leaves

Arrange oven racks in the lower and upper third of the oven. Heat the oven to 475 degrees. Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to make two 12-inch rounds and transfer to two ungreased baking sheets (or two 12-inch pizza pans). Arrange the tomatoes on top of the dough, overlapping them slightly. Drizzle the pizza with oil and season well with salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake pizzas for 10 minutes, remove from the oven, top with the mozzarella and basil, and bake 5 minutes longer, until the cheese melts and the edges of the pies are crisp and lightly browned.

Serves 4.

*1 cup white flour
*1/4 cup salt
*2 tablespoons cream of tartar
*1 cup water
*2 teaspoons food coloring
*1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Mix flour, salt and cream of tartar in a medium pot.  Add water, food coloring and oil.  Stir over medium heat for 3-5 minutes.  Don't worry if the mixture looks like a globby mess; it'll turn into dough!  When the mixture forms a ball in the center of the pot, take it out and put it on a floured surface.  Squish it and punch it around a bit; this is called kneading.  When you are done, put it in a plastic bag or airtight container and store it in the fridge.

Disclaimer: I copied the amounts for all of the ingredients off of the recipe card, but Dad says he actually has no idea how much of anything he really puts in when he makes it.  So if you make this and it doesn't taste good, give Dad grief.


*8-10 medium potatoes (not russet) or equivalent amt. red potatoes, unpeeled
*2 cups diced onions
*2 cups celery, chopped
*1/2 cup vinegar
*1/4 cup sugar
*2 cups mayonnaise
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/2 teaspoon pepper


Cut potatoes into bite sized pieces, and boil for 15-20 minutes, or until fork inserts easily into potato.  Drain, and rinse in cold water until cool.  Combine with remaining ingredients and refrigerate until serving.

*1/2 cup apricot (or peach) jam or preserves 
*2 jalapenos, sliced into rings and seeded 
*1 red onion, roughly chopped 
*8 small flour or corn tortillas, warmed 
*1 cup fresh cilantro leaves 
*1 lime, cut into wedges

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place 2 large sheets of aluminum foil on a work surface, one atop the other. Cut the visible fat off the pork.  Place the pork in the center of the foil and season on all sides with the salt, pepper, and cumin. Spoon jam over the pork, turning to coat. Scatter the jalapenos and onion around the pork. Fold the double layer of foil around the pork and crimp the edges to seal tightly. Place in a 9&quot; square baking dish. Roast until fork-tender, about 4 - 4 1/2 hours; let cool. Unwrap the pork, reserving the juices and discarding the foil. Use a fork to shred the pork. Transfer to a bowl. Pour the cooking juices, onion, and jalapenos over the pork and toss. Serve with the tortillas, cilantro, and lime wedges.  Also good with Dinosaur bar-b-que sauce.

Makes 6 servings.

This is the Cortesi family favorite (crustless) quiche.  We usually make it with sausage from the freezer.

*8 oz meat (sausage or ham)
*8 oz cheese (swiss, mozzarella or mild cheddar)
*1/2 cup flour or bisquick
*2 egg
*2 cups milk
*salt &amp; pepper to taste
*paprika

Prepare meat (brown sausage and cut into 1/2&quot; pieces, or dice ham) and grate cheese. Mix all ingredients with a wire whisk, beating eggs separately first.  Pour into a greased quiche dish or deep dish pie plate. Sprinkle with paprika.  Bake in 425 degree oven for 30 minutes.

Serves 4-6.

[[Image:Moroccan Chicken 3.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Quick Moroccan Chicken with Peaches]]
Very excellent.  I also recommend adding large pieces of green peppers to the pan about 2 minutes before cooking is done.

*1 rotisserie chicken (pre-cooked), cut into pieces

*1 box (10 oz.) couscous

*2 tsp. olive oil
*1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced

*1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar
*Pinch ground nutmeg
*1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
*1/2 cup orange juice
*1 can (15 oz.) diced peaches, drained
OR 1/2 qt. jar Mom's pickled peaches, drained

*1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves (optional)
*1/2 green pepper, cut in 1&quot; pieces (optional)

Cook the couscous according to the box directions.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the sugar, nutmeg, vinegar, and orange juice and bring to a simmer.  Add the peaches and continue to simmer until the liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. -OR- Heat oil and garlic, as above.  Substitute 1/2 qt. jar of Mom's pickled peaches for the next 5 ingredients.  Simmer, as above.  Add parsley and/or green pepper, as desired.

Divide the couscous and chicken among individual bowls, top with the peach mixture, and sprinkle with the parsley (if using).

Serves 4-6, depending on size of chicken

(Also known as Tim and Stacy's [http://cortesifood.com/wiki/Engagement_Chicken_(Chicken_with_Soup_%26_Rice) Engagement Chicken])


*1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts


Marinade: 

*3 garlic cloves, minced
*Juice of 2 limes (1/4 cup)
*1/3 cup soy sauce
*3 tablespoons tequila (optional)
*1 tablespoon brown sugar
*1 teaspoon onion salt
*1/2 teaspoon black pepper


Salsa Dressing:

*1/4 cup sour cream
*2 tablespoons mayonnaise
*2 tablespoons chunky salsa
*1/2 teaspoon Cajun spice
*1 dash dried dill weed
*1 dash cumin
*1 cup shredded Colby jack cheese
*2 cups crumbled tortilla chips


Mix marinade from garlic, lime juice, soy sauce, tequila, brown sugar, onion salt, and pepper.  Cut chicken into 6 pieces, and marinade it in a zip-lock bag at least 4 hours or overnight. Whisk together sour cream, mayo, salsa, Cajun spice, dill weed, and cumin.  Refrigerate whisked salsa dressing until needed, at least 1 hour. Grill marinated chicken breasts over a medium flame (or in a frying pan) about 8 minutes on each side, until done. Place cooked chicken on a broiler pan (or 9&quot;x9&quot; square pan), spread salsa dressing over each breast and sprinkle with cheese. Broil until cheese has melted and browned slightly. Serve chicken on a bed of crumbled chips with an optional lime wedge.

Add Spanish/Fiesta rice and chunky salsa on the side for a meal.

Serves 5-6

This recipe comes from Becky's college friend Rachel.  It is a really good snack.

*1 sleeve saltines
*1/2 cup brown sugar
*1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
*1 bag chocolate chips
*Toppings of your choosing, for example: coconut, sprinkles, crushed peppermint, nuts, or toffee (heath) bits

Line a baking sheet with tin foil &amp; spray with Pam.  Line with saltines so that they are touching &amp; flat; break edge crackers as needed to cover the entire sheet.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Melt brown sugar &amp; butter in small saucepan, stirring constantly until smooth.  Pour over the saltine mixture (it won't totally cover everything).  Bake for 7 minutes.  Remove from oven &amp; sprinkle chocolate chips over the top.  Let sit for 1 minute and spread with spatula.  Sprinkle with toppings as desired.  Refrigerate and let cool.  Break into pieces; can store in a plastic bag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1042">[[Image:Red Lobster biscuits.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Red Lobster Cheddar Biscuits]]Very good (If you're careful not to mix them too much, they're really awesome, just like Red Lobster Cheddar Biscuits).

Dough:
*1 1/4 pounds (~ 5 cups) Bisquick
*3 oz. freshly shredded cheddar cheese
*11 oz. (about 1 1/3 cups) cold water

Garlic Spread:
*1/2 cup melted butter
*1 tsp. garlic powder
*1/4 tsp. salt
*1/8 tsp. onion powder
*1/8 tsp. dried parsley

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Cover 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper (NOT wax paper).  Combine Bisquick, cheese and water in a large mixing bowl. Mix gently - just until Bisquick is incorporated, being careful NOT to over mix, as this will quickly result in tough biscuits.  Using a small scoop, place the dough in mounds on the baking pans.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. While biscuits bake, combine Garlic Spread ingredients.  Brush baked biscuits with the garlic topping.  Best served warm from the oven.

Makes 24 biscuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1072">[[Image:reeses.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Reese's Chewy Chocolate Cookies]]This is also a standard recipe (from the back of the peanut butter chips bag), but it is very good (and makes cookies that are chocolate dough with peanut butter chips in them).


*1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter or margarine, softened
*2 cups sugar
*2 eggs
*2 teaspoons vanilla
*2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
*3/4 cup cocoa
*1 teaspoon baking soda
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*2 cups (12 oz. package) peanut butter chips


Cream butter or margarine and sugar until light and fluffy in large mixer bowl.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; blend into creamed mixture.  Stir in peanut butter chips.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 9 minutes.  (Do not overbake.  Cookies will be soft.  They will puff during baking, flatten upon cooling.)  Cool on cookie sheet until set, about 1 minute; remove to wire rack to cool completely.


Makes about 6 dozen.

Very excellent German dish.  Don't eat the strings.

*Bracoile (~1 pound) -- see note below
*1 medium onion, finely diced
*4 slices of bacon, uncooked
*Salt and pepper to taste
*2 tablespoons vegetable oil
*4 potatoes, cut into bite sized pieces

Cut meat into sections approximately 4&quot; x 6&quot;.  Cut each slice of bacon in half and put two halves on each piece of meat.  Cover bacon with onions and salt and pepper to taste.  Roll up and tie with 2-3 strings (use &quot;kitchen string&quot; or kite string). Brown in vegetable oil, and cook up to 2 hours in 1&quot; water.  After meat has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours, add potatoes to water to cook for remaining 30 minutes.

Serves 4.

Note:If you cannot find Bracoile, have a round steak cut 1/8-1/4&quot; thick.

*1 large egg
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*1 heaping teaspoon sugar
*1/2 tsp. vanilla
*1 cup flour
*1 cup whole milk OR 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup water

Mix all ingredients together except flour.  Add flour.  Dip irons in hot cooking fat, then momentarily in batter, then back in fat, until golden brown.  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.

*2 1/2 cups flour (whole wheat)
*Water as needed

Note: it is preferable to use 1-day-old dough (keep in fridge prior to use.

Mix flour with enough water to make doughy (be careful not to add too much flour to
dough or bread will be too dry).  Put dough mixture in bowl, wet top, cover with saran wrap and put in freezer while making chicken / rice.

Remove dough from freezer and roll thin (1/8&quot;).  Put flat 6” pancake in frying pan with small amount of pam cooking spray.  Cook until done on one side (approx. 20 seconds) and then flip over; cook on other side.  Slide bread halfway out of pan and hold bread over burner to let it dry and bubble.  Repeat on other end.  Continue until dough is gone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1414">Pretty good; a bit different from restaurant samosas.

*3 large potatoes, cut in quarters
*3 small long green chili peppers
*2 onions, chopped small
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
*1/2 rounded teaspoon of garam masala
*1 1/2 cups of frozen peas
*1/2 tomato, chopped small (like in salsa)
*Samosa pads (paper thin doughy “noodle” pads, at least 3&quot; inches wide (like won-tons))
*Olive oil (for frying samosas)

Prepare filling: Boil potatoes until done (fork inserted comes out easily).  Also microwave frozen peas to heat.  Combine chili peppers and onions in a bowl.  Add salt, red chili powder, and garam masala and tomato.  When potatoes are done, drain, cut them into 3/4” chunks, and add to the bowl along with drained peas and mix gently.

Make samosas: Open samosa pad packet and cover pads with moist cloth towel (to prevent from drying out).  Cut pads into approximately 3” squares.  Put a small amount of filling in the center of each square, and fold over to make a triangle pillow packet.  Seal the edges of the packet with water (like a pie crust).  Heat about a half inch of oil in frying pan.  Gently place several samosa packets into the oil; cook until golden on one side and then carefully flip to cook on other side.  Remove from oil and let drain on paper towels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="907">This recipe is also from the green &quot;Win Her With Dinner&quot; book, and is essentially a fancy name for zucchini cooked in a frying pan.  It tastes really good though (and I am not even a big fan of zucchini).

*2 shallots
*1 large zucchini
*3 large garlic cloves
*2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
*Salt and pepper to taste

Rinse the zucchini, then cut off and discard the ends.  Slice the rest into 1/4&quot; thick disks.  Remove paper from shallots and garlic cloves.  Thinly slice shallot into rings, and finely dice garlic.  Heat the olive oil or butter in a large frying pan until warm / melted.  Add the slice shallot and chopped garlic.  Cook, stirring, until the shallot looks soft.  Add the zucchini and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and add salt and pepper to taste.

Serves 3.

Grandmother used to make these for us for special breakfasts (and let the dough rise on the radiator).  Mom lets the dough rise in the sunshine in her bedroom where its warm.

Dough:
*1 package yeast
*1/4 cup warm water
*3/4 cup milk (warm)
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/4 cup sugar
*1 egg
*1/4 cup soft shortening
*3 1/4 - 4 cups flour

Filling:
*4 Tbl margarine, softened, divided
*1/2 cup sugar
*4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
*1 cup raisins, divided

Butterscotch-Pecan Topping:
*1 cup margarine or butter
*1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
*48 pecan halves

Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl.  Stir in milk, sugar, shortening, salt, egg and 2 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth.  Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 min. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up.  Cover with damp cloth; let rise in warm place until double, abt 1 1/2 hours.  (Dough is ready if an indentation remains when touched). Punch dough down with floured fist and divide in half.

Before rolling dough into rectangles, heat margarine or butter until melted; stir in brown sugar.  Spray Pam in each of 24 muffin tin cups, and distribute melted mixture into the cups (or spray Pam in a 9&quot; x 13&quot; and 9&quot; x 9&quot; pan and spread melted mixture in them).  Position 24 pairs of 2 pecan halves, upside down in each cup (or in rows - 3 across by 5 down, and 3 by 3, in respective pans).  

Roll half dough into rectangle, 15x9 inches, on lightly floured surface.  Spread with half of the  margarine.  Mix sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle half over rectangle.  Sprinkle half of the raisins on top.  Roll up tightly, beginning at long side.  Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal well and stretch roll to make even.  With scissors, cut roll in half, and then each half in half, and then each section into thirds, yielding 12 individual rolls.  Turn each roll in its side and center over each pair of pecan halves.
  
Repeat with remaining half of dough.  Cover pans with a damp cloth.  Let rise until double, about 40 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake until golden brown, 25-30 minutes.  Immediately invert pan onto foil-lined cookie sheet.  Let pan remain a minute so butterscotch can drizzle over rolls.

Yield: 24 'Sticky Buns'

Also Shrimp Newburg is the really good shrimp thing that Canoe Island Lodge always has at the end of the buffet table on Saturday night (right before the meat carving dude).

Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 15 minutes
Total Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients:

* 12 corn tortillas
* 1 28oz can of red enchilada sauce
* 2 cups (16 oz) mozzarella or queso blanco
* 1 1/2 cups meat (optional) shredded beef or chicken
* 2-3 tablespoons oil

Preparation:

Coat each tortilla with oil using your hands or a brush. Spread out on a cookie sheet or baking dish and bake in a 500 degree oven for about 7 minutes. Take out to cool until they are warm to the touch.
The cheese can be shredded, or just cut into slices 3-4 inches long, and 1/4 inch thick. (Or thicker if you like them really cheesy.)

Pour just enough sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 glass baking dish to cover the it. Pour the rest of the sauce in a large bowl. Dip tortillas, one at a time, in the bowl to coat with sauce.

Lay the tortilla in baking dish and if you're using the meat, put in about 2-3 tablespoons. Place the cheese on top of the meat. Fold one edge over the cheese, then the other one, then turn the whole thing over, folded side down, in baking dish. Repeat for each tortilla. Sprinkle any leftover sauce and/or cheese on top of enchiladas.

Place in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted.

This gingerbread and apple &quot;slop&quot; is great to make over a camp fire.

*1 14.5 oz. box gingerbread mix
*Ingredients to prepare gingerbread mix as usual (egg, water)
*48 oz. jar of applesauce or 5 cups homemade

Prepare gingerbread mix, following directions on box, using a wire whisk.  Pour applesauce into the bottom of a large ungreased 6 qt. pot (Dutch oven).  Applesauce will be about 2&quot; deep.  Pour prepared gingerbread batter over applesauce.  Cover pot, and cook on medium, then med-low heat until applesauce boils and cake is done (about 25 minutes on a stove, but it will depend on how hot the camp fire is).  Do not stir.  Serve warm (with ice cream or whipped cream if desired).

Serves 6-8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1213">These are not actually kabobs, they are actually chicken and split pea patties.  Serve with version 1 of Fehma's rice (instructions earlier in chapter).

*1 lb. yellow split peas
*3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
*3 small long green chili peppers, diced
*1 large onion, diced
*1 teaspoon garam masala
*1 teaspoon red chili pepper powder
*1 teaspoon salt
*2 eggs, beaten
*Olive oil

Cover split peas with water in large pot and boil until soft (approximately 30 minutes).  Meanwhile, cook chicken in oil (a couple tablespoons) until done.  When both peas and chicken are cooked, combine together and mash with a potato masher to make a thick paste.  Add the chili peppers and the onion to pea/chicken paste.  Add garam masala, red chili pepper powder, and salt.  Form into 2” round patties (make sure to press together firmly to prevent patty from falling apart).  Add a small amount of water to eggs; dip each patty into the egg wash mixture before frying, to just barely coat patty.  Heat approx 1/4 cup of oil in a frying pan; fry each patty until golden brown, turning once.

This recipe is from Tyler's America's Test Kitchen book.  It is a great summer dessert - easy to make, tastes delicious, and looks pretty enough to serve to guests.


*1 (9 x 9 1/2-inch) sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
*1 large egg, lightly beaten
*1/4 cup granulated sugar
*3/4 cup heavy cream, chilled
*1 1/2 cups vanilla pudding (just follow the directions on a box mix to make this)
*1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
*1 quart strawberries, hulled &amp; sliced
*Confectioners' sugar for dusting


Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Cut the puff pastry into 12 rectangles, transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.  Brush the rectangles with the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with the granulated sugar.  Bake until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes.  Let the pastry rectangles cool for 15 minutes, then split them in half using the serrated knife.

Whip the cream with an electric mixer set on low until frothy, about 1 minute.  Increase the speed to high and continue to whip until smooth, thick, and doubled in volume, 1 to 3 minutes.  Add the pudding and vanilla to the whipped cream and whip until stiff, about 1 minute.  Spread 1/8 cup of the pudding mixture over the bottom of each pastry square, then top with 1/4 cup berries.  Spoon another 1/8 cup of the pudding mixture over the berries.

Gently press the pastry tops into the pudding mixture to adhere, then lightly dust with the confectioners' sugar.  Dollop the remaining pudding mixture attractively on top of each pastry before serving.

To Make Ahead: The puff pastry can be baked, cooled, wrapped in plastic wrap, and stored at room temperature up to 24 hours in advance.  The cream and pudding mixture can be whipped together up to 2 hours before assembling the napoleons.  After being assembled, the pastries will hold in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before they begin to turn soggy.

*1 large head of cabbage, yielding 8-12 cabbage leaves
*1 pound hamburger
*1/2 cup uncooked instant rice
*1/8 teaspoon garlic salt
*1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce, divided
*1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
*1 medium onion, chopped (abt. 1/2 cup)
*1 can (4 oz.) mushroom stems and pieces, undrained
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/8 teaspoon pepper
*1 teaspoon sugar
*1 tablespoon cornstarch
*1 tablespoon water


Separate 8-12 leaves from cabbage (Remove core with pointed knife; plunge whole cabbage into boiling water for 30 sec; remove, gently loosen and peel off whatever outside leaves you can.  Put cabbage back into the boiling water and repeat until you have enough leaves). Cover leaves with boiling water; cover and let stand 10 minutes until leaves are limp; drain. Mix hamburger, rice, onion, mushrooms, salt, pepper, garlic salt, and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce. Place 1/3 cup hamburger mixture at stem end of each leaf (a little more in larger leaves). Roll leaf around mixture, tucking in sides. Place cabbage rolls seam sides down in ungreased 8x8&quot; baking dish. Mix remaining tomato sauce, sugar, and lemon juice; pour over cabbage rolls. Cover and cook at 350 degrees until hamburger is done, about 45 minutes. Mix cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in saucepan. Stir in liquid from cabbage rolls. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Serve sauce with cabbage rolls.

Serve with a green salad.


Makes 8-12 rolls (6 servings).

Excellent - Grandmother used to make this for us for breakfast (and let the dough rise on the radiator).

Dough:
*1 package/envelope yeast
*1/4 cup warm (105-115 degrees) water
*3/4 cup lukewarm milk (scalded, then cooled)
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/4 cup sugar
*1 egg
*1/4 cup soft margarine/butter
*4 cups flour, + 2 for kneading/rolling

Cinnamon-Raisin Filling:
*4 tablespoons softened margarine/butter, divided btwn 2 rings
*1/2 cup packed brown sugar, divided btwn 2 rings
*2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided btwn 2 rings
*1/2 cup raisins, divided btwn 2 rings

Glaze:
*1 cup powdered sugar
*1 tablespoon milk
*1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Decoration:
*24 pecan halves, divided btwn 2 rings
*12 maraschino cherries, halved, divided btwn 2 rings


Dissolve yeast in warm water in lg bowl.  Mix in milk, salt, sugar, egg and margarine.  Add 2 cups flour and blend together until smooth.  Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes), adding more of the flour as needed.  Place in bowl that has been greased with margarine, then turn greased side up.  Cover with damp cloth and let rise in warm place until doubled (about 1 1/2 - 2 hours).  Punch dough down with floured fist and divide in half.

Roll half of the dough into a rectangle, 9&quot; x 15&quot;, on a lightly floured surface.  Spread with margarine/butter, and sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon and raisins.  Roll up tightly, beginning at long side.  Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal well and stretch roll to make even.  With sealed edge down, shape into ring on lightly greased cookie sheet.  Pinch ends together.  With scissors, make cuts 2/3 of the way through ring at 1&quot; intervals.  Turn each section on its side.  Repeat above with remaining half of the dough.  Let rise until double, about 40 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake until golden brown, 25-30 minutes.  (If tea ring browns too quickly, cover loosely with aluminum foil.)  Let cool, then drizzle on glaze (below) and decorate with pecans and cherries.

To make Glaze:
Mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla until glaze is smooth an of desired consistency.

Yield: 2 rings

Its similar to the Chocolate Nut &quot;Pie&quot; recipe, only with crunchy Oreos.  


*1 15 oz. pkg. Oreo cookies
*1 cup butter or margarine
*8 oz. cream cheese
*1 8 oz. tub Cool Whip, divided
*1 cup confectioner's sugar
*1 lg. pkg. (5.8 oz) instant chocolate pudding


Crush cookies and sprinkle in bottom of 9x13&quot; pan.  Leave about 8 cookies for top.  Melt butter and pour over cookies, and mix.  Let stand in refrigerator for one hour.

Mix cream cheese, 1/2 container of Cool Whip and powdered sugar until smooth.  Spread over cookies.
Make pudding per box instructions, and gently spread over cream cheese mixture.  Refrigerate another hour.

Spread remaining Cool Whip on top and sprinkle with reserved crushed cookies.  Refrigerate or freeze approximately one hour before serving.


To serve, immerse bottom 1/2&quot; of pan in hot water to soften the bottom layer before cutting.

I think we had this when we were at Aunt Rene's for Thanksgiving one year.  Neither Mom nor I actually remember eating it, but the recipe card says &quot;Excellent&quot; so hopefully it is.  Note from Mom:  I made it and it is really good!

*1 bag tater tots (26 oz. - 1 1/2+ lbs.)
*1 onion, chopped
*8 oz. (1 cup) sour cream
*1 can cream soup (celery, mushroom, chicken...)
*2 cups (abt. 6 1/2 oz) shredded cheddar cheese
*1 lb. (2 cups) frozen green beans
*1/2 stick (melted) margarine

Pour green beans into greased 9x13&quot; pan.  Sprinkle with onions.  Combine sour cream &amp; soup in a bowl and distribute spoonfuls on top of onions.  Cover with tater tots &amp; sprinkle with shredded cheese.  Pour melted margarine on top.  Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.

Serves 8

*1 cup frozen strawberries
*1 medium banana, cut into chunks
*1 handful of ice
*About 1/4 cup orange juice

Put all ingredients in blender.  Cover and blend on high speed about 30 seconds or until smooth.  Pour mixture into 3 glasses.

Notes: Apple Juice works as a good base instead of OJ.  You also might want to try raspberries, peaches, blueberries, or any other fruit you have available.

*10 flour tortillas (6 inch)
*1 can (16 oz.) tomatoes, cut up
*1 can (15 oz.) can tomato sauce
*1 cup finely chopped green pepper
*1/2 cup sliced green onions
*1/4 cup snipped parsley or cilantro
*1 teaspoon chili powder
*1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
*1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
*2 cups chopped cooked turkey
*1 sm. package (3 oz.) cream cheese, softened
*1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese (4 oz.)


Lightly grease 7x11&quot; pan.  Wrap the stack of tortillas tightly in foil.  Heat at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  For the sauce, in a saucepan combine undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, green pepper, onions, parsley, chili powder, red pepper, and cumin.  Bring to boiling.  Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes.  For turkey mixture, in medium mixing bowl combine half the sauce, the turkey, the cream cheese, and half the shredded cheese.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the turkey mixture onto each tortilla; roll tortilla.  Place tortillas, seam side down, in prepared pan.  (Squeeze them in at the end - they WILL all fit).  Bake, covered, in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Pour remaining tomato sauce over tortillas, down the center; sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.  Bake, uncovered, 8 to 10 minutes more or til the sauce is hot.  Serve immediately.  May garnish with black olives and parsley sprigs before serving.


Makes 4-5 servings.

This recipe is from Real Simple and is a good alternative to traditional ground beef meatloaf.

*1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
*1 small yellow onion, chopped
*1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
*1 egg, beaten
*1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
*2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
*1 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
*1 jar (7 oz.) roasted red peppers, cut into 1/2&quot; pieces
*3/4 teaspoon salt
*1/2 teaspoon pepper

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl.  Put into 8&quot; or 9&quot; loaf pan.  Bake until no trace of pink remains (internal temperature should be 165 degrees), about 45 minutes.  Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before slicing.

Makes 5 servings.

Serve with baked potatoes, green beans or broccoli &amp; a salad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">This is one of my favorite dishes that Tyler makes.  Rachel will like it because it involves pounding chicken breasts.

*3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
*2 tablespoons butter or margarine
*1 container Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry or Blackened Steak Magic
*3 servings pasta (recommended: bowties or linguine)
*1 jar Trader Joe's Alfredo sauce
*Vegetables of your choice (recommended: fresh peas, broccoli, or halved cherry tomatoes)

Boil water and cook pasta, following directions on box.  Pound chicken breasts to even thickness.  Melt butter/margarine in microwave and brush it on both sides of the chicken.  Coat both sides of chicken with seasoning.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat dry cast iron skillet (on high) to smoking point.*  Place chicken in pan (do not crowd) and sear for approximately 3 minutes on each side.  Finish cooking chicken by placing cast iron pan (with chicken) in oven for approximately 5 minutes.  While chicken is cooking, heat alfredo sauce.  Slice chicken into about 1/2&quot; thick slices, and serve with vegetables over hot pasta tossed in alfredo sauce.

Note: If you do not have a cast iron pan, you can alternatively make this dish by searing the chicken in a hot frying pan, and then moving it to a glass baking dish to finish cooking it in the oven.

Serves 4.

*6 oz. frozen lemonade
*6 oz. orange juice (regular, not frozen, but if you can't wait to defrost and reconstitute, just estimate about a spoonful and add 5-6 oz. of water)
*6 oz. rum, or water for virgin daiquiris
*1/2 bag (abt 8 oz or 1 cup) frozen strawberries (or more, especially if they are store bought and don't have a lot of color or flavor)
*Ice (about same quantity as strawberries, maybe more)

Put all ingredients in blender and blend (add ice, and water if needed, until blender vortex disappears).  Serve in tulip-shaped stemmed glasses with whipped cream and a fresh strawberry as garnish, if you are feeling fancy, or the traditional CIL plastic cups if you are serving a thirsty crowd.  Enjoy!

This recipe fills about 8 CIL sized plastic cups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1086">[[Image:karailas.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Vegetables (Karailas and Onions)]]This is the vegetable side dish that Fehma makes with that weird bumpy green vegetable.  It cooks down to almost nothing, and is rather spicy, but really good!

*4 karailas (green bumpy cucumber-looking vegetables)
*2 onions, cut against grain into long, thin slices
*4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
*1 1/2 teaspoon salt
*1 teaspoon red chili pepper powder
*1/2 tomato, cut into small chunks
*Olive oil (for cooking vegetables)

Prepare karailas: Scrape off bumps with knife, slice karaila in half lengthwise, and remove white seeded center.  Cut halved karaila horizontally to create 3/4&quot; chunks.  Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in frying pan; saute karaila chunks until browned.  Remove from pan, set aside.  Saute onions and garlic in oil until browned. Add salt and red chili pepper powder.  Add karaila chunks to frying pan. Cook everything together on low heat until very soft and mushy.  Just before serving, add tomatoes and heat through.

Makes abt 2-3 cups

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3172">[[Image:White chocolate raspberry cheesecake.jpg|300px|thumb|right|White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake]]This is pretty much the recipe for the Cheesecake Factory's White Chocolate Raspberry 'Truffle'.  It is Mom's very favorite.

Crust:
*1 1/2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs (abt 20 Oreo cookies, (minus the filling), crumbled)
*1/3 cup margarine, melted

Filling:
*1/2 cup seedless raspberry preserves
*1/4 cup water
*4 (8 oz) pkgs cream cheese (room temperature)
*1 1/4 cups sugar
*1/2 cup sour cream (room temperature)
*2 tsp vanilla
*5 eggs (room temperature)
*4 oz. white chocolate, chopped into chunks

Garnish:
*2 oz shaved white chocolate (optional)
Redi Whip (whipped cream)


Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  Place a large pan filled with abt 1/2&quot; water into the oven while it preheats (this will be your water bath).  Combine the raspberry preserves with 1/4 cup water in a medium microwave-safe bowl.  Heat for 1 1/2 min on high in the microwave. Stir until smooth.  Allow preserves to cool, then put the bowl into the refrigerator until later. Measure 1 1/2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs into a medium bowl.  Mix in 1/3 cup melted margarine.  Press the crumb mixture into a greased 9&quot; spring-form pan.  Press the crumb mixture flat into the bottom of the pan and abt 2/3 the way up the side.  Wrap a large piece of foil around the bottom of the pan to keep the cheesecake in the water bath and prevent it from leaking.  Put the crust in the freezer until the filling is done.  Use an electric mixer to combine the softened cream cheese with the sugar, sour cream and vanilla.  Mix on the lowest setting for a couple minutes or until the ingredients are smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides frequently.  (Don't beat too much air into the mixture, or it will fall and be grainy).  Whisk the eggs in a medium bowl and then add them to the cream cheese mixture.  Blend the mixture just enough to integrate the eggs.  Remove the crust from the freezer and sprinkle 4 oz of white chocolate chunks onto the bottom of the crust.  Pour half of the cream cheese filling into the crust.  Drizzle the raspberry preserves over the entire surface of the filling.  Use a butter knife to swirl the raspberry into the cream cheese.  Just a couple passes is fine - you don't want to blend the raspberry and cream cheese together too much.  Pour the other half of the filling into the crust.  Carefully place the cheesecake into the water bath in the oven.  Bake for 12 min at 475 degrees, then '''turn the oven down to 350 degrees''' and bake for 50 - 60 min or until the top of the cheesecake turns a light brown or tan color.  Remove the cheesecake from the oven to cool on a cooling rack.  When the cheesecake is completely cool, cover cheesecake with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to sit overnight.  Before serving, sprinkle the entire top surface of cheesecake with 2 oz of shaved white chocolate.  To serve, slice the cheesecake into 12 equal portions.  Apply a pile of fresh whipped cream to the top of each slice and serve.

Serves 12

[[Image:Spaghetti dinner.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Wilkens Spaghetti Sauce]]
This recipe comes from the Camponera family that lived in the white house across from the gate, when Grandmother and Granddaddy first got married and moved into the yellow house on the farm.  It is the recipe we always use to make spaghetti sauce.  I recommend it without the mushrooms.  Also if you are planning to use it for lasagna, make sure you add extra hamburger meat. 
 
*1 clove garlic, minced (or 1+ tsp garlic powder)
*1 lg. onion, chopped
*2 pounds hamburger meat
*2 large cans (29 oz. each) of tomato puree
*4 cans (29 oz. each) tomato sauce
*1 can mushrooms (optional)
*1 teaspoon salt
*1/8 teaspoon pepper
*1 teaspoon oregano
*1/2 teaspoon basil

Brown hamburger meat; add garlic and onion and cook until onion is soft, then drain any excess fat.  Add all other ingredients.  Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

You can change the amount you make, but make sure the 2:1 ratio between tomato puree and sauce, and oregano and basil stays the same.

This is a recipe that Rachel kluged together (from assorted modifications of an original recipe) for Tim's friend Zack before their cruise.  It is absolutely the best carrot cake we've ever had!

Carrot Cake:
*4 eggs
*3/4 cup canola or vegetable oil
*1/2 cup applesauce
*1 cup white sugar
*1 cup brown sugar
*3 tsp vanilla extract
*2 cups flour
*2 tsp baking soda
*2 tsp baking powder
*1/2 tsp salt
*3 tsp cinnamon
*1/4 tsp nutmeg
*1 cup (8 oz) crushed pineapple, well drained
*3 cups shredded carrots
*1 cup chopped walnuts

Cream Cheese Frosting:
*1/2 cup butter, softened
*8 oz cream cheese, softened
*3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
*1 tsp vanilla extract
*1 cup chopped walnuts

Carrot Cake:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease either a 9 x 13 pan or 2 9&quot; round pans.  In a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, applesauce, white &amp; brown sugars &amp; vanilla.  Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Stir in pineapple &amp; carrots.  Fold in walnuts.  Pour into prepared pan(s).  Bake in the preheated oven for 40 - 50 min (for 9 x 13 pan) or 35 - 40 min (for 2 9&quot; round pans), or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  Let cool in pan for 15 min., then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

Cream Cheese Frosting:
In a medium bowl, combine butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and vanilla.  Beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy.  Stir in chopped walnuts.  Frost the cooled cake.

Serves 10 - 12.
