Pretty good; a bit different from restaurant samosas.

-   3 large potatoes, cut in quarters
-   3 small long green chili peppers
-   2 onions, chopped small
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
-   1/2 rounded teaspoon of garam masala
-   1 1/2 cups of frozen peas
-   1/2 tomato, chopped small (like in salsa)
-   Samosa pads (paper thin doughy “noodle” pads, at least 3" inches
    wide (like won-tons))
-   Olive oil (for frying samosas)

Prepare filling: Boil potatoes until done (fork inserted comes out
easily). Also microwave frozen peas to heat. Combine chili peppers and
onions in a bowl. Add salt, red chili powder, and garam masala and
tomato. When potatoes are done, drain, cut them into 3/4” chunks, and
add to the bowl along with drained peas and mix gently.

Make samosas: Open samosa pad packet and cover pads with moist cloth
towel (to prevent from drying out). Cut pads into approximately 3”
squares. Put a small amount of filling in the center of each square, and
fold over to make a triangle pillow packet. Seal the edges of the packet
with water (like a pie crust). Heat about a half inch of oil in frying
pan. Gently place several samosa packets into the oil; cook until golden
on one side and then carefully flip to cook on other side. Remove from
oil and let drain on paper towels.
