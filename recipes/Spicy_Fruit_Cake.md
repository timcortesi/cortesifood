Note: I just want to clarify that I do not actually like this (or any
other) fruit cake, and it is only in here because Mom is making me put
it in here. As fruit cakes go, this one is not that bad.

-   2 cups brown sugar
-   6 eggs

Cream shortening and sugar. Slightly beat eggs and add to creamed mix.
Add eggs. Sift dry ingredients. Stir into sugar mixture alternately with
