 This is the vegetable side dish
that Fehma makes with that weird bumpy green vegetable. It cooks down to
almost nothing, and is rather spicy, but really good!

-   4 karailas (green bumpy cucumber-looking vegetables)
-   2 onions, cut against grain into long, thin slices
-   4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
-   1 1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon red chili pepper powder
-   1/2 tomato, cut into small chunks
-   Olive oil (for cooking vegetables)

Prepare karailas: Scrape off bumps with knife, slice karaila in half
lengthwise, and remove white seeded center. Cut halved karaila
horizontally to create 3/4" chunks. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in
frying pan; saute karaila chunks until browned. Remove from pan, set
aside. Saute onions and garlic in oil until browned. Add salt and red
chili pepper powder. Add karaila chunks to frying pan. Cook everything
together on low heat until very soft and mushy. Just before serving, add
tomatoes and heat through.

Makes abt 2-3 cups
