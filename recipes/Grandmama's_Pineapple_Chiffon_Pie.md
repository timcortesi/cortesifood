I don't think I actually know what this is, but Mom says it is good, so
it probably is.

-   1 can condensed milk
-   1 can (16 oz.) crushed pineapple
-   1 cup chopped pecans
-   1/2 cup lemon juice
-   1 large container Cool Whip
-   2 graham cracker pie shells.

In a 375 degree oven, bake pie shells 8 to 10 minutes until golden
brown. Remove and cool. Combine condensed milk with lemon juice. Mix
well and add pineapple. Fold in Cool Whip and pecans.

Pour into pie shells and let set (in refrigerator) 3 hours or more. May
decorate with colored sugar before serving.

Makes two 9" pies.
