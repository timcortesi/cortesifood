 This is a recipe that Rachel
kluged together (from assorted modifications of an original recipe) for
Tim's friend Zack before their cruise. It is absolutely the best carrot
cake we've ever had!

Carrot Cake:

-   4 eggs
-   3/4 cup canola or vegetable oil
-   1/2 cup applesauce
-   1 cup white sugar
-   1 cup brown sugar
-   3 tsp vanilla extract
-   2 cups flour
-   2 tsp baking soda
-   2 tsp baking powder
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   3 tsp cinnamon
-   1/4 tsp nutmeg
-   1 cup (8 oz) crushed pineapple, well drained
-   3 cups shredded carrots
-   1 cup chopped walnuts

Cream Cheese Frosting:

-   1/2 cup butter, softened
-   8 oz cream cheese, softened
-   3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
-   1 tsp vanilla extract
-   1 cup chopped walnuts

Carrot Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease either a 9 x 13 pan or
2 9" round pans. In a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, applesauce,
white & brown sugars & vanilla. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking
powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in pineapple & carrots. Fold in
walnuts. Pour into prepared pan(s). Bake in the preheated oven for 40 -
50 min (for 9 x 13 pan) or 35 - 40 min (for 2 9" round pans), or until a
toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool
in pan for 15 min., then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

Cream Cheese Frosting: In a medium bowl, combine butter, cream cheese,
confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth and
creamy. Stir in chopped walnuts. Frost the cooled cake.

Serves 10 - 12.
