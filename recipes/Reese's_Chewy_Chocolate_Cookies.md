 This is also a standard recipe
(from the back of the peanut butter chips bag), but it is very good (and
makes cookies that are chocolate dough with peanut butter chips in
them).

-   1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter or margarine, softened
-   2 cups sugar
-   2 eggs
-   2 teaspoons vanilla
-   2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
-   3/4 cup cocoa
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   2 cups (12 oz. package) peanut butter chips

Cream butter or margarine and sugar until light and fluffy in large
mixer bowl. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Combine flour, cocoa,
baking soda and salt; blend into creamed mixture. Stir in peanut butter
chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 350
degrees for 8 to 9 minutes. (Do not overbake. Cookies will be soft. They
will puff during baking, flatten upon cooling.) Cool on cookie sheet
until set, about 1 minute; remove to wire rack to cool completely.

Makes about 6 dozen.
