Really good on a chilly, rainy day; spicy; works well for making the day
before.

-   10 flour tortillas (6 inch)
-   1 can (16 oz.) tomatoes, cut up
-   1 can (15 oz.) can tomato sauce
-   1 cup finely chopped green pepper
-   1/2 cup sliced green onions
-   1/4 cup snipped parsley or cilantro
-   1 teaspoon chili powder
-   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
-   2 cups chopped cooked turkey
-   1 sm. package (3 oz.) cream cheese, softened
-   1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese (4 oz.)

Lightly grease 7x11" pan. Wrap the stack of tortillas tightly in foil.
Heat at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. For the sauce, in a saucepan combine
undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, green pepper, onions, parsley, chili
powder, red pepper, and cumin. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer,
uncovered, 5 minutes. For turkey mixture, in medium mixing bowl combine
half the sauce, the turkey, the cream cheese, and half the shredded
cheese. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the turkey mixture onto each tortilla;
roll tortilla. Place tortillas, seam side down, in prepared pan.
(Squeeze them in at the end - they WILL all fit). Bake, covered, in a
350 degree oven for 20 minutes. Pour remaining tomato sauce over
tortillas, down the center; sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.
Bake, uncovered, 8 to 10 minutes more or til the sauce is hot. Serve
immediately. May garnish with black olives and parsley sprigs before
serving.

Makes 4-5 servings.
