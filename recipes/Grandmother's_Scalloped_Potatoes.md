Very good; we often have this with ham for Easter.

-   3 lbs. potatoes
-   Flour
-   1/2 stick butter
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   Milk
-   Grated cheddar cheese

Peel and slice potatoes into 1 1/2" - 2" rounds, about 1/8" thick. Place
1 layer of sliced potatoes in the bottom of a 9x9" square glass pan.
Sprinkle lightly with flour, and dot with butter (about 1 tablespoon
total). Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Repeat to make 3 layers.
Pour milk into pan until you can barely see it below the top layer.
Cover top layer with grated cheddar cheese, and bake in a 350 degree
oven for approximately 1 hour (until the potatoes are soft in the
middle).

Serves 6.
