  This is one
of the recipes that came from the Food for Thought thing that Mom and
Dad used to do at the church, while we climbed on the cribs in the
nursery (and then got yelled at). This one is actually really good
(unlike the spinach one!)

-   2+ cups cut up fresh broccoli
-   2 chicken breasts, par boiled, boned and cut up
-   1 can cream of chicken/celery/broccoli/mushroom soup
-   1/2 cup mayo
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   4 slices American or cheddar cheese
-   Approx. 1/4 cup bread crumbs

Layer broccoli and chicken in 8" x 8" pan. Mix together soup, mayo, and
lemon juice, and pour over top of the broccoli and chicken. Layer cheese
slices on top. Sprinkle bread crumbs over cheese. Bake for 30 to 45
minutes at 350 degrees. Serve over rice.

Serves 4.
