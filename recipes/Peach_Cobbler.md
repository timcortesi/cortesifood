Very easy and good recipe for making peach cobbler.

-   6-8 peeled and sliced peaches (4-5 cups)
-   1 cup sugar
-   3 tablespoons cornstarch
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1 cup Bisquick baking mix\*
-   1 tablespoon sugar
-   1/3 cup milk
-   cinnamon sugar

Mix peaches, sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in saucepan. Heat and boil
gently until thickened. Pour into oven-proof 9x9" baking dish. Prepare
Bisquick with sugar and milk. Spoon about 8-9 piles onto fruit. Sprinkle
with cinnamon sugar. Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.

Serves 8.

Note: If you don't have any Bisquick, you can instead make the biscuits
by cutting 3 tablespoons margarine into: 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon
sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add 1/2 cup
milk. (Note that the quantities of sugar and milk are different from
those listed above).
