down this recipe for me, so ask Mom if it isn't right.

-   1 16 oz. box lasagna noodles
-   24 oz. ricotta cheese (abt 3 cups)
-   16 oz. part skim mozzarella cheese, sliced with cheese cutter
-   Parmesan cheese
-   Spaghetti sauce with hamburger meat

Boil noodles in large pot of water with 1 tsp oil added for 11 min.
Drain noodles. Spoon enough sauce to thinly cover the bottom of a 9" x
13" pan. Place 1st layer of noodles along bottom of pan, overlapping
edges. Put spoonfuls of ricotta cheese on top of noodles, and cover with
pieces of mozzarella cheese. (Use abt 1/3 of both cheeses per layer).
Add a layer of sauce to just cover the cheeses & noodles, and gently
smear around. Repeat layering process to fill pan (3 layers). The top of
the lasagna should be a final layer of noodles covered with sauce (and
you can use up any other cheese you have leftover, but make sure to
spread it around evenly). Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top of the sauce.

Bake in 350 degree oven for approximately 45 minutes. Serve with a green
salad and Italian bread. Freezes well.

Serves 6-8
