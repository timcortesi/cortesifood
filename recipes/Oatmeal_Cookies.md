This is the recipe that Mom uses to make oatmeal cookies. She usually
adds in the nuts and raisins.

-   3/4 cup margarine
-   1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   1 egg
-   1/4 cup water
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   1 1/4 cup all purpose flour
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-   3 cups oats, uncooked
-   1 cup chopped nuts
-   1/2 cup raisins

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat together margarine, sugars, egg, water
and vanilla until creamy. Mix in flour, salt & baking soda. Stir in
oatmeal, nuts & raisins. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased
cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes. (For variety, add
chocolate chips or coconut.)

Pan cookie variation: Grease 9 x 13" pan. Spread batter in pan. Bake at
375 for 25-30 min until golden brown, and center is set. When completely
cool, cut like brownies.
