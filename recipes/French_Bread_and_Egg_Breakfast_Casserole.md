 This is good to
make for company (since it serves a lot and you can make it the night
before).

-   1 small loaf French bread
-   2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
-   12 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten
-   1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
-   1/2 cup whole milk
-   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter or margarine, melted
-   1 - 1 1/2 cup(s) chopped ham or sausage
-   3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves (optional)
-   6 strips crisply cooked bacon, crumbled (optional)

The night before serving, cut the bread into 1-inch-thick slices and
spread with the softened butter. Butter a large glass oval or round
baking dish that is no deeper than 2 to 3 inches deep; or 9 x 13" pan.
Layer the bread in the dish, then add the beaten eggs, cheese, milk,
ham, and melted butter. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
overnight.

In the morning, remove the dish from the refrigerator and let sit at
room temperature for about an hour. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake until
golden brown and puffy, 50 to 60 minutes. If desired, garnish with
parsley, bacon, and/or freshly sliced tomatoes. Serve immediately, as it
cools quickly.

Makes 8 servings.
