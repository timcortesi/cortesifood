 This is what we always had on St.
Patrick's Day (with green milk).

-   Corned Beef (comes with seasoning packet)
-   4-6 potatoes
-   3-4 peeled carrots
-   1/2 head of cabbage, cored

Put the corned beef in a Dutch oven (6 qt. pot), cover with water, add
the seasoning packet, and boil per package instructions. One hour before
the end of the suggested cooking time, cut up potatoes and carrots into
1" chunks, and put into the pot. Cut cabbage into wedges (after coring),
and put into pot on top of everything else.  Make sure to add enough
water to barely cover the vegetables.  When done, remove contents of pot
with slotted spoon onto platter.

Serve with green applesauce!
