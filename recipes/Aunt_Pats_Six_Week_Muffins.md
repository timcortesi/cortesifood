 Aunt Pat makes the
batter for these muffins ahead of time, and then keeps it up to six
weeks in the refrigerator. This makes it easy to make warm muffins for
unexpected guests.

-   1 box (15 oz.) raisin bran cereal
-   3 cups sugar
-   5 cups flour
-   5 teaspoons baking soda
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   4 eggs
-   1 cup melted margarine
-   1 quart buttermilk

Mix cereal, sugar, flour, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Add beaten
eggs, margarine and buttermilk. Mix together. Let sit overnight so
moisture can be absorbed into the flakes. Spoon out desired amount into
greased cupcake cups and cook at 400 degrees for 20 minutes for large
muffins, or 15 minutes for little muffins. Store remaining batter in
covered container in refrigerator for up to 6 weeks.
