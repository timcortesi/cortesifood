Those of you who have come to visit me in Virginia will know that this
is an excellent appetizer served at the Bonefish Grill. Mom loved it so
much that she got our waiter to write down the recipe. Note that the
instructions he gave us for the sauce will make a ton of sauce, so don't
actually make that much. Mom has the label from the chili sauce to show
anyone who wants to see what it looks like.

Sauce:

-   1 gallon mayo
-   3 cups garlic chili sauce
-   1/2 cup lemon juice
-   1 cup Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce
-   1/2 cup white vinegar

Other stuff:

-   Shrimp
-   Lettuce

To make sauce: Mix all ingredients together; makes 6 quarts.

To make shrimp: Deep fry shrimp first, then toss in sauce. Use about 7
oz. of shrimp with about 2 oz. of sauce, for one serving. Serve on a bed
of lettuce.
