These are the regular meatballs that we usually have with spaghetti and
spaghetti sauce. You can freeze them if you would like.

-   1 lb. ground beef (at least 85% lean)
-   2 eggs
-   2 slices wet bread
-   1/4 cup parmesan cheese
-   1 teaspoon parsley
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   Dash of pepper
-   Dash of garlic

Mush together by hand. Roll into balls abt the size of golf balls, and
either fry in olive oil or broil until brown on 1 side, turn each with a
spoon, and return to broiler until golden.

When spaghetti sauce has been cooking for 1 hour, put meatballs into
sauce and cook for 1/2 hour.

Makes 24 meatballs.
