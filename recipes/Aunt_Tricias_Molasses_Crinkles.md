 Very excellent (and
I don't even like molasses). Rachel eats these by the dozen.

-   3/4 cup soft margarine
-   1 cup brown sugar
-   1 egg
-   1/4 cup molasses
-   2 1/2 cups flour
-   2 teaspoons baking soda
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon cloves
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1 teaspoon ginger
-   1 cup raisins
-   Granulated sugar

Mix shortening, sugar, egg and molasses thoroughly. Add dry ingredients.
Stir in raisins. Chill, if desired. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Roll dough
in 1 1/4" balls. Roll balls in sugar. Put them 3" apart on greased
baking sheet, and bake 10-12 minutes.

Makes 4 dozen cookies.
