  An easy breakfast.

-   Whatever pancake / waffle ingredients are listed in the directions /
    box mix you are using
-   Other stuff to add (fruit or chocolate chips), if desired

Follow the directions on any Bisquick box, pancake mix, etc (may need to
adjust milk up a tablespoon or so, depending on mix for correct
consistency, and add an egg), or the Betty Crocker cookbook (Mom's is
page 197 - and she adds an extra tablespoon milk). Â Add some finely
chopped apple pieces to the batter, or blueberries or chocolate chips to
individual pancakes immediately when the batter's on the griddle. For
pancakes, use abt 1/4 cup per pancake, and cook on very hot greased
griddle; turn when bubbles pop. For waffles, spray Pam thoroughly on the
waffle iron - top and bottom, EVERY time. Use a little less than 1/4 cup
per section of Belgian waffle maker, or barely enough to fill the waffle
iron sections of a regular waffle iron (remember, it expands). Cook
until the light goes off on the machine, or the waffles are golden
brown. Serve with maple flavored (not real maple) syrup warmed in the
microwave in a glass container (not in the plastic bottle it comes in
otherwise you get in trouble with Tyler about the plastic chemicals in
your syrup). If you do happen to want to warm it in the plastic bottle,
open the spout first so the bottle doesn't explode while heating.
