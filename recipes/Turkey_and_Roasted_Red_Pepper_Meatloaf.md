 This recipe is from
Real Simple and is a good alternative to traditional ground beef
meatloaf.

-   1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
-   1 small yellow onion, chopped
-   1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
-   1 egg, beaten
-   1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
-   1 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
-   1 jar (7 oz.) roasted red peppers, cut into 1/2" pieces
-   3/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon pepper

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl.
Put into 8" or 9" loaf pan. Bake until no trace of pink remains
(internal temperature should be 165 degrees), about 45 minutes. Transfer
to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before slicing.

Makes 5 servings.

Serve with baked potatoes, green beans or broccoli & a salad.
