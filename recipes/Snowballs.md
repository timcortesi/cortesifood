 This
is pretty much the favorite Cortesi family Christmas cookie. Mom usually
multiplies this recipe by four when she makes it.

-   3/4 cup margarine (1 1/2 sticks)
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 tablespoon cold water
-   1/8 teaspoon salt
-   2 cups sifted flour
-   1 cup chocolate chips
-   1 cup chopped pecans
-   Colored sugar (additional sugar mixed with a few drops of food
    coloring)

Combine first five ingredients (margarine, vanilla, sugar, cold water,
and salt). Stir in flour, pecans, and chocolate chips. Form into 1"
balls; place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 30 minutes at 300
degrees. Roll in colored sugar while still warm.

Makes 5 dozen cookies.
