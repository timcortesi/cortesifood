This is one of my favorite dishes that Tyler makes. Rachel will like it
because it involves pounding chicken breasts.

-   3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
-   2 tablespoons butter or margarine
-   1 container Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry or Blackened Steak Magic
-   3 servings pasta (recommended: bowties or linguine)
-   1 jar Trader Joe's Alfredo sauce
-   Vegetables of your choice (recommended: fresh peas, broccoli, or
    halved cherry tomatoes)

Boil water and cook pasta, following directions on box. Pound chicken
breasts to even thickness. Melt butter/margarine in microwave and brush
it on both sides of the chicken. Coat both sides of chicken with
seasoning. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat dry cast iron skillet (on
high) to smoking point.\* Place chicken in pan (do not crowd) and sear
for approximately 3 minutes on each side. Finish cooking chicken by
placing cast iron pan (with chicken) in oven for approximately 5
minutes. While chicken is cooking, heat alfredo sauce. Slice chicken
into about 1/2" thick slices, and serve with vegetables over hot pasta
tossed in alfredo sauce.

Note: If you do not have a cast iron pan, you can alternatively make
this dish by searing the chicken in a hot frying pan, and then moving it
to a glass baking dish to finish cooking it in the oven.

Serves 4.
