 Marion Button made this for us when
we stayed with them in Rhode Island, and it is very good. You might want
to halve the recipe because it makes tons!

-   1 lb. fresh crab meat (1 1/2 cups) (or use imitation, if you're not
    in Rhode Island)
-   8 oz. sour cream
-   2 pkgs. (each 8 oz.) cream cheese
-   1/4 cup mayonnaise
-   1/2 tsp. garlic powder
-   juice of 1/2 lemon (or 1 1/2 Tbl lemon juice)
-   1 tsp. dry mustard
-   1-3 tablespoons milk (enough to make creamy)
-   3 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
-   1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar
-   Paprika

Combine all ingredients except for paprika. Spread in 9" x 9" baking
dish or 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan and sprinkle with paprika. Bake for 20
to 25 minutes at 350 degrees until bubbly. Use as a dip, or spread on
crackers.

Makes 5-6 cups
