This fruit salad recipe comes from a friend of mine at work, and it is
excellent. You can make it for a picnic and eat the leftovers for
breakfast.

-   Small watermelon
-   Red grapes
-   Nectarines
-   Blueberries

(The exact quantities of the fruit can vary depending on what you want
your fruit salad to taste like. You can also of course add any other
fruit you want, but I happen to like this particular mixture.)

Ball watermelon, remove grapes from branches, chop nectarines, and rinse
blueberries and remove any stems. Mix all ingredients in bowl, and
serve.
