 Mom remembers Aunt Ruth making
these cookies (with pink frosting for Valentine's Day) when Mom visited
Ohio when she was 16. Mom later got the recipe from her to make when
Becky was 3. It is a good recipe to use when you want to make cookies
with cookie cutters.

-   1 cup sugar
-   1 cup margarine/butter
-   2 eggs
-   5 tablespoons sour cream
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   4 cups flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   2 teaspoons baking powder
-   Dash of salt

<!-- -->

-   Frosting (butter cream or canned)

In large mixing bowl, combine first five ingredients; beat until creamy.
In separate bowl, combine remaining (dry) ingredients, and then add to
first mixture. Chill dough overnight. Dough will be sticky, so only
remove 1/4 of it at a time from the refrigerator, and place on lightly
floured surface (Do not use powdered sugar). Roll 1/4 inch thick and cut
into shapes. Bake on greased cookie sheets at 350 degrees for 8 to 10
minutes. Do not over-bake! Cookies should be lightly browned on bottom
and white on top. Cool on racks and frost.

Note: Dough can be kept in refrigerator for several days or frozen for 2
months.
