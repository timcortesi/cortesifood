Rachel found this recipe and it is pretty good.

-   1 tablespoon + 1/2 cup olive oil
-   1/2 red onion, chopped
-   1 teaspoon chopped garlic
-   1/2 red pepper, chopped
-   1/2 green pepper, chopped
-   1/2 zucchini, chopped
-   Salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cinnamon to taste
-   1/4 cup golden raisins
-   1/4 cup chickpeas
-   1 cup orange juice
-   12 oz. plain couscous
-   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
-   1/2 cup mandarin oranges
-   Mint spring for garnish, if desired

Cook couscous as per instructions on the box; set aside. Heat 1
tablespoon olive oil in large frying pan. Saute onion, garlic, red and
green peppers, and zucchini. Season with spices. Add remaining 1/2 cup
olive oil, raisins, chickpeas, and orange juice, and heat until warm.
Remove from pan (with juices) to large mixing bowl, and gently fold in
couscous, parsley and mandarin orange sections. Mound mixture onto a
serving platter and garnish with mint sprig, if desired. (Goes well with
Beef Shish Kabob and Moroccan Salad).

Serves 6.
