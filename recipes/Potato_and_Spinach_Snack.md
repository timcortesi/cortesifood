These are the fried "snacks" that we really love!

-   2 1/2 cups chick pea powder
-   2 rounded teaspoons garam masala
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   3 teaspoons red chili powder
-   1/2 cup plain yogurt (plus additional for dipping)
-   1/2 cup water
-   1 onion, chopped small
-   2 large potatoes, thinly sliced, then cut in long thin strips
    (julienne style)
-   6 oz. fresh spinach, chopped
-   Approx 4-5 small long green chili peppers, very finely diced
-   Olive oil

Combine all ingredients (except for oil) in mixing bowl to make thick
batter; (might need to add a little additional water to make more
doughy). Heat about 1/2 an inch of oil in frying pan. Gently place/lay 1
large spoonful of doughy mixture into the oil. Cook until done on one
side and then carefully flip to cook on other side. Remove from oil and
drain on paper towels. Serve warm, with additional plain yogurt.

Serves 12.
