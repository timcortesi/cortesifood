 Very good. I think
this is from Real Simple.

-   1 1/2 lbs. ground beef
-   1/2 cup bread crumbs
-   3/4 cup pesto
-   1 egg
-   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
-   3/4 teaspoon pepper
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   Grated Parmesan cheese

Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup pesto, egg, salt, and pepper
in large mixing bowl. Form into 12 meatballs (1/4 cup each). Bake at 350
degrees for 15 minutes. Turn, and then bake for another 10 minutes.
Combine remaining 1/4 cup of pesto with olive oil, and spoon over
meatballs. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Serve with couscous.
