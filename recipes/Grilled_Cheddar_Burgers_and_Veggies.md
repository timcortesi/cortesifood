 (aka 'foil dinners' +!)
Rachel (who found this recipe) is being annoying right now and says "mmm
I have no idea" when I ask her for details about this recipe. Actually,
it is really good - the cheddar and Worcestershire are good additions to
the traditional campfire recipe.

-   1 pound lean ground beef
-   1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (4 ounces)
-   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
-   6 medium green onions, 2 chopped (2 tablespoons) and 4 sliced (1/4
    cup)
-   1 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt, divided
-   2 medium yellow Yukon potatoes, thinly sliced
-   1 1/2 cups baby carrots (abt 16 - cut into 1/2" pieces)
-   12 cherry tomatoes, cut in half, (or 1 med tomato, diced) if desired

Heat coals or gas grill for direct heat. Spray half of one side of four
18x12" sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil with cooking spray.

Mix beef, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, 2 Tbl chopped onions, and 1
teaspoon seasoned salt. Shape mixture into 4 patties, about 1 inch
thick. Place potatoes on sprayed sides of foil sheets. Top with beef
patty, carrots, tomatoes and sliced onions; sprinkle with 1/2 tsp
seasoned salt. Fold foil over patties and vegetables so edges meet. Seal
edges, making tight 1/2" fold; fold again. Allow space on sides for
circulation and expansion.

Cover and grill packets 4-6" from medium heat 20-30 minutes or until
potatoes are tender, turning packets half way through. Remove from heat;
cut large X across top of packet; fold back foil. CAUTION: steam will
escape - contents will be very hot!

Serves 4.
