This is the really good salsa that we make in the salsa maker. Rachel
recommends using lime juice instead of lemon juice but I don't. You can
eat it alone or mix it with Velveeta cheese.

-   2 medium ripe tomatoes (quartered)
-   1/4 medium onion (quartered)
-   4 springs cilantro (parsley)
-   2 cloves of garlic
-   1 teaspoon garlic salt
-   2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice
-   1 jalapeno (1/3 for mild, 2/3 for medium, all for hot and spicy)
-   Velveeta cheese (optional)

Put all the ingredients (except cheese) in the Salsa Express (or food
processor) and mix to consistency desired. Serve with tortilla chips.

If desired, combine 1 lb. (16 oz.) Velveeta cheese (cut up) with 1 cup
salsa and microwave for 3 minutes. Stir, and microwave for another 2
minutes, or until cheese is melted.
