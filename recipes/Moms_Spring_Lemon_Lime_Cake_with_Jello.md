  This is
the very good lemon cake that Mom makes with the lime jello in it on the
first day of Spring.

Cake:

-   Lemon cake mix (and any ingredients required for normal preparation)
-   1 small box lime jello mix
-   3/4 cup boiling water
-   1/2 cold water

Topping (see note below):

-   1 envelope Dream Whip
-   1 small box lemon instant pudding mix
-   1 1/2 cups cold milk

Prepare 9 x 13" lemon cake normally, following box instructions. Let
cake cool completely in pan.

Fully dissolve lime jello mix in the boiling water, stirring 2 min. Add
cold water and stir. Refrigerate until jello begins to thicken (just
under 1 hour). Whisk thoroughly.

Poke holes in cake 1" apart and pour jello in holes. Make sure each hole
gets filled with jello by banging pan gently on counter, and
redistributing jello on top of cake to fill holes.

To make topping: Combine Dream Whip, lemon instant pudding mix, and
milk. Beat for 3-8 minutes and refrigerate. Spread on cake before
eating.

Note: Alternatively, if Dream Whip is unavailable (like if you move to
Houston),to make the topping without Dream Whip, use 1 cup cold milk, 1
cup Cool Whip, and lemon instant pudding mix.
