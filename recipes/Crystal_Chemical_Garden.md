This is good for making a temporary crystal sculpture that looks like
broccoli/coral; ask Mom about it. Do not eat it. (Rachel and Pita, this
means you!)

-   6 tablespoons salt
-   6 tablespoons blueing (chemical in sm plastic bottle - look in
    laundry detergent section of store)
-   6 tablespoons water
-   1 tablespoon ammonia
-   A few drops of assorted food coloring

Combine all ingredients well. Arrange pieces of broken bricks\* in
bowl\*, and pour about 1/2 of the salt mixture evenly over the bricks.
(Reserve the remaining mixture in a tightly sealed jar). Put a dot of
different colors of food coloring on the edges and tops of different
bricks. Place in location where it won't be disturbed and wait for the
crystals to grow/bloom. Reserved solution can be added at the base
occasionally (after a week?) to keep the crystals growing. You can also
add additional drops of food coloring at growth sites. The Crystal
Garden will have the appearance of coral and will be soft and powdery
(and fragile!). It will keep growing even after all the liquid has
evaporated.

-   Note: can substitute 6 charcoal briquettes or any other porous
    material (sponges, etc) for the brick pieces; and an aluminum pie
    tin for the bowl.
