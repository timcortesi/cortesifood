This is good to eat with the EPCOT's Moroccan Salad, and Coucous Salad
(which are in the Side Dishes section).

-   24 oz. beef tenderloin, cut into 1 inch cubes
-   1/2 cup onions, finely chopped
-   2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
-   2 tablespoons ground coriander
-   1 tablespoon paprika
-   1/4 cup olive oil
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   1 teaspoon cumin
-   8 eight inch skewer sticks

Combine all ingredients and mix well. (Rachel then like to marinade this
in a covered bowl for 2 hrs.) Put 4 oz. beef on each skewer stick. Cook
over a bed of hot coals on a barbecue grill or broil in oven until
tender, about 5-8 minutes, turning 1/2 way through.

Serves 5.

Serve with EPCOT's Moroccan Salad and Couscous Salad.
