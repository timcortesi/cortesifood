  This recipe came
from Mom and Dad's 2nd grade teacher who went to Mom's church. It is
Mom's regular recipe for meatloaf. Just in case anyone was wondering, I
do not actually like this. I am putting it in the book because I know
that Andrew does.

-   2 lbs. ground beef (at least 85% lean or higher)
-   1/2 green pepper (diced)
-   2 stalks celery, with leaves (chopped)
-   1 onion (minced)
-   1 egg (beaten)
-   1 tsp. salt
-   1/4 cup milk
-   1 cup bread crumbs
-   1 tsp. mustard
-   Dash of marjoram
-   Dash of basil
-   Dash of oregano

Mix all ingredients together and put in a 9" x 5" loaf pan. Bake for 1
hour at 375 degrees.

Serve with baked potato, green beans & salad or steamed apples.

Serves 6-8
