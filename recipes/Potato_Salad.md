 This
is (in theory) the potato salad that we often have in the summer with
barbequed chicken or hamburgers. Disclaimer: I copied the amounts for
all of the ingredients off of the recipe card, but Dad says he actually
has no idea how much of anything he really puts in when he makes it. So
if you make this and it doesn't taste good, give Dad grief.

-   8-10 medium potatoes (not russet) or equivalent amt. red potatoes,
    unpeeled
-   2 cups diced onions
-   2 cups celery, chopped
-   1/2 cup vinegar
-   1/4 cup sugar
-   2 cups mayonnaise
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon pepper

Cut potatoes into bite sized pieces, and boil for 15-20 minutes, or
until fork inserts easily into potato. Drain, and rinse in cold water
until cool. Combine with remaining ingredients and refrigerate until
serving.

Serves 8-10
