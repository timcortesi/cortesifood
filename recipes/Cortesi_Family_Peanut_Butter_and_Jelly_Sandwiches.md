 Rachel's Version:

-   2 slices bread
-   1 jar peanut butter
-   1 jar jelly
-   1 dill pickle spear
-   fritos

Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread, and jelly on the other.
Sprinkle jelly side with fritos. Cut the dill pickle into 5 large chunks
and put them on the bread slice spread with peanut butter. For the top
of the sandwich, slam the 2 slices together. You will know that it is
well made if the large pickle chunks are almost poking through the top
of the bread.

Serve with some dog food.

Dad's Version:

-   2 slices bread
-   1 jar peanut butter
-   1 jar jelly

Put the two slices of bread on a plate, and serve. Note: the bread
should not have any peanut butter or jelly spread on it. If the person
you are serving the sandwich to tries to ask why the sandwich doesn't
have anything on it, tell them not to argue with you and send them to
their room.
