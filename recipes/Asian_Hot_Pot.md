Rachel makes this and it is good. Tim - there is no meat in this recipe
so you will want to add chicken.

-   1 package (3.75 oz.) cellophane (bean thread) or thin rice noodles
    (from the Asian food aisle at the store)
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   8 oz. shiitake or other mushrooms, stems discarded and caps thinly
    sliced
-   6 cups vegetable or low-sodium chicken broth
-   2/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
-   2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
-   1 teaspoon chili or hot pepper sauce to taste (optional)
-   4 whole scallions thinly sliced
-   4 carrots, thinly sliced
-   8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces

Prepare the noodles according to the package directions. Meanwhile, heat
the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and
cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the broth, soy sauce,
ginger, and chili sauce (if using) and combine. Bring to a boil. Add the
scallions, carrots, and green beans. Simmer until the vegetables are
tender, 5 to 6 minutes.

Drain the noodles and cut into 3-inch lengths. Divide among individual
bowls and ladle the soup over the top.

Makes 4 servings.

Tip: If you prefer a more substantial soup, substitute 8 ounces of
angel-hair pasta or whole-wheat spaghetti, breaking the strands into
pieces before cooking.
