Pretty good, but not as good as Dinosaur Barbeque so probably you should
just eat there instead.

-   2 to 2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder
-   2 teaspoons kosher salt
-   1 teaspoon black pepper
-   2 teaspoons ground cumin
-   1/2 cup apricot (or peach) jam or preserves
-   2 jalapenos, sliced into rings and seeded
-   1 red onion, roughly chopped
-   8 small flour or corn tortillas, warmed
-   1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
-   1 lime, cut into wedges

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place 2 large sheets of aluminum foil on a
work surface, one atop the other. Cut the visible fat off the pork.
Place the pork in the center of the foil and season on all sides with
the salt, pepper, and cumin. Spoon jam over the pork, turning to coat.
Scatter the jalapenos and onion around the pork. Fold the double layer
of foil around the pork and crimp the edges to seal tightly. Place in a
9" square baking dish. Roast until fork-tender, about 4 - 4 1/2 hours;
let cool. Unwrap the pork, reserving the juices and discarding the foil.
Use a fork to shred the pork. Transfer to a bowl. Pour the cooking
juices, onion, and jalapenos over the pork and toss. Serve with the
tortillas, cilantro, and lime wedges. Also good with Dinosaur bar-b-que
sauce.

Makes 6 servings.
