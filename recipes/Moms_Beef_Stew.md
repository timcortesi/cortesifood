 This is the way that Mom
makes beef stew.

-   1 lb. stew meat cut into 1 inch cubes
-   1 tablespoon margarine
-   1 large onion, cut up
-   3 cups water
-   1 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
-   1/8 teaspoon pepper
-   2 large potatoes, cut into 1 1/2" pieces
-   2 medium carrots, cut into 1" pieces
-   1 stalk celery, cut into 1" pieces
-   1/2 teaspoon Gravy Master (browning liquid w/ flavoring)
-   1 beef bouillon cube
-   1 bay leaf
-   1 can (28 oz.) chopped tomatoes

Brown stew meat margarine in a Dutch oven for about 10 min.  Add onion
and cook another 5 minutes or until onions are tender.  Add water, 1/2
teaspoon salt, and pepper.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and
simmer until beef is almost tender - approx 2 hours.  Stir in potatoes,
carrots, celery, Gravy Master, 1 teaspoon salt, beef boullion cube, and
bay leaf.  Add chopped tomatoes.  Cover and simmer until vegetables are
tender, approximately 30 minutes.  Remove bay leaf before serving.

Mom also adds [parsley dumplings](Parsley_Dumplings) :  Mix
the dough, drop by 8-10 spoonfuls onto hot stew meat or vegetables (not
directly into liquid).  Cook uncovered 10 minutes; then cover and cook
another 10 minutes.
