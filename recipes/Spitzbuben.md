This is the recipe for the sandwich cookies with the jelly in them that
Dad loves but never wants to make because they take a lot of effort.

-   2 cups flour
-   3/4 cups (1 1/2 sticks) margarine, at room temperature
-   1 cup sugar
-   1/2 cup very finely chopped almonds
-   Jelly or jam
-   Confectioner's sugar

Beat together flour, butter, sugar, and almonds to a smooth dough.
Chill. Roll out on surface covered with light dusting of confectioner
sugar, to 1/16" thickness. Cut into circles with 2" biscuit cutter. Cut
out centers of half the circles. Bake on ungreased baking sheet in oven
preheated to 350 degrees, for 5-6 minutes until delicately browned.
Remove. Put jam on the circles, top with rings so that jam shows in
center. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.

Makes approximately 2 dozen cookies.
