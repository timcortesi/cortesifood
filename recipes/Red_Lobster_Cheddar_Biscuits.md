 Very good (If
you're careful not to mix them too much, they're really awesome, just
like Red Lobster Cheddar Biscuits).

Dough:

-   1 1/4 pounds (\~ 5 cups) Bisquick
-   3 oz. freshly shredded cheddar cheese
-   11 oz. (about 1 1/3 cups) cold water

Garlic Spread:

-   1/2 cup melted butter
-   1 tsp. garlic powder
-   1/4 tsp. salt
-   1/8 tsp. onion powder
-   1/8 tsp. dried parsley

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Cover 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper
(NOT wax paper). Combine Bisquick, cheese and water in a large mixing
bowl. Mix gently - just until Bisquick is incorporated, being careful
NOT to over mix, as this will quickly result in tough biscuits. Using a
small scoop, place the dough in mounds on the baking pans. Bake 10 to 12
minutes or until golden brown. While biscuits bake, combine Garlic
Spread ingredients. Brush baked biscuits with the garlic topping. Best
served warm from the oven.

Makes 24 biscuits.
