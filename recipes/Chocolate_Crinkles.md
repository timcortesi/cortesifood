 Very good, but don't
burn them because then they are less good.

-   1/2 cup vegetable oil
-   4 oz unsweetened chocolate (melted)
-   2 cups granulated sugar
-   4 eggs
-   2 teaspoons vanilla
-   3 cups flour
-   2 teaspoons baking powder
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 cup confectioners' sugar

Mix oil, chocolate, and granulated sugar. Blend in one egg at a time
until well mixed. Add vanilla. Measure flour by sifting, and stir flour,
baking powder and salt into oil mixture. Chill several hours or
overnight. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Drop teaspoon-fuls of dough into
confectioners' sugar. Roll in sugar and shape into balls. Place about 2"
apart on greased baking sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes. Do not overbake.
