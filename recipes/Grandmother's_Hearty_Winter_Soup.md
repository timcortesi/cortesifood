Soup](/File:Grandmother's_hearty_winter_soup.jpg "wikilink")

This is (a version of) the soup Grandmother always used to make for us
while we were working making wreaths and selling Christmas trees in
December. If it doesn't taste exactly right, that is because she didn't
know all of the exact quantities. She says to just experiment and it
will be fine.

-   1 lb. ground beef, browned
-   1-2 onions, chopped
-   1 quart canned or chopped tomatoes (28 oz. can)
-   1 small bag frozen mixed vegetables
-   3 carrots, cut up
-   1 beef bouillon cube
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon marjoram
-   1 bay leaf
-   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1 tablespoon parsley
-   1/4 teaspoon pepper
-   1 can cream of mushroom soup or celery or broccoli or tomato soup
-   2 cans water (use empty soup can for measuring)

In a large pot, brown the meat, then add the onions. Cook until the
onions are soft. Add the rest of the ingredients, and simmer for 1-2
hours. Serve with kaiser rolls (preferably from Joe Camera's Deli in
Shrub Oak, NY, which is where Grandmother gets her rolls from), butter,
Christmas music, fresh wreaths, and snow.
