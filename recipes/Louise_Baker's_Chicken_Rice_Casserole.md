  This is
another recipe we got from the church thing where we played in the cribs
and got in trouble.

-   3 cups cooked chicken, cut up
-   1 cup minute rice
-   2/3 cup chopped celery
-   2/3 cup chopped carrots
-   1/4 cup chopped pimento (2 oz)
-   1 tsp. salt
-   1/4 tsp poultry seasoning (combo: sage, thyme, marjoram, black
    pepper, cloves)
-   2 cups chicken broth
-   4 eggs, well beaten
-   2 cups broken soft bread

Gravy:

-   1 can cream of mushroom or celery soup
-   1/3 can milk

Cook minute rice according to package directions (can be cooked in the
liquid from cooking the chicken). Mix all ingredients (except gravy)
together. Pour into greased 2 qt. baking dish. Bake for 55 minutes at
350 degrees. Mixture will be rather thin but bakes thick. (If there
isn't enough broth from cooking the chicken, use either canned broth or
bouillon cubes. If using bouillon cubes, adjust the salt lower.) To make
gravy, combine soup with milk using a wire whisk. Heat in microwave.
When baked, cut into servings and serve with gravy, a green salad and
dinner rolls.

Serves 6-8
