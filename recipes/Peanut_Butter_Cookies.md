 This is the recipe
that we use to make those peanut butter cookies that have the fork
pattern pressed into them. It is NOT the same dough that we use for the
[Peanut Blossoms](/Peanut_Blossoms "wikilink") .

-   1 cup sugar
-   1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
-   1 cup margarine (2 sticks)
-   1 cup extra crunchy peanut butter
-   2 eggs
-   2 1/2 cups flour
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   1 tsp baking powder
-   1/2 tsp salt

In large bowl, cream sugar, brown sugar, and margarine. Blend in peanut
butter, and eggs. Blend in flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Chill dough for an hour. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Roll into balls the
size of large walnuts. Place 3" apart on lightly greased baking sheet.
Flatten with a fork dipped in flour (criss-cross). Bake until golden and
set but not hard (10-12 min).

Yield: About 6 dozen cookies
