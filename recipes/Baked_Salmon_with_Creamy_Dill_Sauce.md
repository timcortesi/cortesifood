This salmon is easy and very good, and tastes excellent with couscous
and blanched snow peas.

-   2 lemons
-   2 servings skinless salmon fillet (1 1/4 lbs. total)
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   3 tablespoons of chopped, fresh dill
-   4 oz. sour cream
-   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

Cut off and discard ends of the lemons. Cut 1 lemon into 6 circular
slices, and cut the other lemon (lengthwise) into quarters. Rinse salmon
in cold water and pat dry with paper towel. Place dark side down in
large baking pan. Squeeze juice of 1 of the lemon quarters over each
piece of fish. Remove any seeds and lightly salt and grind on pepper.
Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the chopped dill over the fish. Cover fish
with 6 lemon slices, and bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

Make sauce for salmon: In mixing bowl, combine sour cream, remaining
chopped dill (approx. 1 tablespoon), and Dijon mustard. Squeeze in juice
of 1 lemon quarter. Remove seeds, and whisk thoroughly. Salt and pepper
to taste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving.

Serves 2.
