 These are the
excellent blueberry muffins that Mom always makes, including the crumb
topping.

Muffins:

-   1 3/4 cups flour
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 cup sugar
-   3 teaspoons baking powder
-   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-   2 eggs
-   1/4 cup oil
-   3/4 cup milk
-   2 cups blueberries

Topping:

-   2/3 cup brown sugar
-   2/3 cup chopped pecans
-   1/4 cup flour
-   2 teaspoons cinnamon
-   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) margarine

Beat eggs until light colored; add milk and oil. Quickly stir milk
mixture into dry ingredients. Fold in blueberries. Fill paper-lined
muffin tins 1/2 to 2/3rds full. In a separate bowl, combine topping
ingredients with fork, until crumbly. Top each muffin with topping. Bake
muffins at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Remove from muffin tins and
cool slightly.
