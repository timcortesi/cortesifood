This fruit leather takes a long long time to make (making it is easy,
but cooking it takes forever), but it is a pretty neat thing to do once,
if you have never done it.

-   5 cups halved strawberries
-   1/4 cup sugar

Place strawberries, 1 cup at a time, in blender. Puree strawberries
until smooth. Stir in sugar. Line two large cookie sheet with plastic
wrap. Secure edges with tape. Spread fruit puree evenly in pans.

Place in 150 degree oven to dry. Leave oven door ajar approximately 4".
Place candy thermometer in back of oven. Check temperature periodically
to be sure it is correct. If necessary, turn oven off for a while to
reduce temperature. Rotate pans every 2 hours. The leather is dry when
the surface is no longer sticky. (Drying time is 6 to 12 hours.)

When dry, remove from oven. Remove plastic wrap. Let cool completely.
When cool, rewrap in plastic wrap by rolling up like a jelly roll.
Leathers can be stored at room temperature for 1 month; in refrigerator
for 3 months and in freezer for 1 year. Makes 2 leathers.
