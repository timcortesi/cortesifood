  This recipe is
from a friend of mine at work, and it is very good.

-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons mustard, divided
-   3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
-   1 1/2 lbs. pork tenderloin
-   1/4 cup white wine
-   1 3/4 cup heavy cream
-   1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Combine vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and
black pepper. Marinate pork in this mixture for up to 8 hours.

Cook pork for 15 minutes at 450 degrees, baste/brush with some of the
white wine, and then continue cooking for another 15 minutes at 400
degrees.

While pork is cooking, make sauce as follows. Heat (stirring with a wire
whisk) cream on medium heat until reduced (about 20 minutes, until
thick). Stir in wine, 1/4 cup mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and white
pepper. Cook for 2 - 3 more minutes, and serve over pork.

Serve with either mashed or roasted potatoes, steamed apples and green
beans. Use extra sauce as gravy over potatoes too.

Serves 4-5
