Mom says these cookies are called "Halfway Cookies" because they are
halfway between a cake and a cookie.

-   1 cup margarine
-   1 1/2 cups brown sugar, divided
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   2 eggs, separated
-   1 tablespoon water
-   2 cups flour
-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 cup chopped nuts
-   1 pkg. (12 oz.) chocolate chips

Cream margarine, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, vanilla, egg yolks, and
water. Next, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt,
and add to creamed mixture. Spread in greased 9 x 13" pan. Sprinkle with
chopped nuts and chocolate chips. Make a meringue topping with the
remaining brown sugar (1 cup) and egg whites, whipped together at high
speed until it turns an off white color - abt 2 min. Very carefully
spread the meringue on top of the chocolate chips. Bake at 375 degrees
for 25 - 30 minutes until meringue is light golden.

Makes 36 bars
