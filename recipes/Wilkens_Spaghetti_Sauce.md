 This recipe comes from
the Camponera family that lived in the white house across from the gate,
when Grandmother and Granddaddy first got married and moved into the
yellow house on the farm. It is the recipe we always use to make
spaghetti sauce. I recommend it without the mushrooms. Also if you are
planning to use it for lasagna, make sure you add extra hamburger meat.

-   1 clove garlic, minced (or 1+ tsp garlic powder)
-   1 lg. onion, chopped
-   2 pounds hamburger meat
-   2 large cans (29 oz. each) of tomato puree
-   4 cans (29 oz. each) tomato sauce
-   1 can mushrooms (optional)
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/8 teaspoon pepper
-   1 teaspoon oregano
-   1/2 teaspoon basil

Brown hamburger meat; add garlic and onion and cook until onion is soft,
then drain any excess fat. Add all other ingredients. Cover and simmer
for 1 1/2 hours.

You can change the amount you make, but make sure the 2:1 ratio between
tomato puree and sauce, and oregano and basil stays the same.
