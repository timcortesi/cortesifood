  This was the
closest Mom could come to getting Dad a Carvel ice cream cake when they
lived in Tennessee, and there were no Carvels within 100+ miles! Its
similar to the Chocolate Nut "Pie" recipe, only with crunchy Oreos.

-   1 15 oz. pkg. Oreo cookies
-   1 cup butter or margarine
-   8 oz. cream cheese
-   1 8 oz. tub Cool Whip, divided
-   1 cup confectioner's sugar
-   1 lg. pkg. (5.8 oz) instant chocolate pudding

Crush cookies and sprinkle in bottom of 9x13" pan. Leave about 8 cookies
for top. Melt butter and pour over cookies, and mix. Let stand in
refrigerator for one hour.

Mix cream cheese, 1/2 container of Cool Whip and powdered sugar until
smooth. Spread over cookies. Make pudding per box instructions, and
gently spread over cream cheese mixture. Refrigerate another hour.

Spread remaining Cool Whip on top and sprinkle with reserved crushed
cookies. Refrigerate or freeze approximately one hour before serving.

To serve, immerse bottom 1/2" of pan in hot water to soften the bottom
layer before cutting.
