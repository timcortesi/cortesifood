This recipe is also from the green "Win Her With Dinner" book, and is
essentially a fancy name for zucchini cooked in a frying pan. It tastes
really good though (and I am not even a big fan of zucchini).

-   2 shallots
-   1 large zucchini
-   3 large garlic cloves
-   2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
-   Salt and pepper to taste

Rinse the zucchini, then cut off and discard the ends. Slice the rest
into 1/4" thick disks. Remove paper from shallots and garlic cloves.
Thinly slice shallot into rings, and finely dice garlic. Heat the olive
oil or butter in a large frying pan until warm / melted. Add the slice
shallot and chopped garlic. Cook, stirring, until the shallot looks
soft. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3
minutes. Remove from heat and add salt and pepper to taste.

Serves 3.
