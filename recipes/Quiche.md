This is the Cortesi family favorite (crustless) quiche. We usually make
it with sausage from the freezer.

-   8 oz meat (sausage or ham)
-   8 oz cheese (swiss, mozzarella or mild cheddar)
-   1/2 cup flour or bisquick
-   2 egg
-   2 cups milk
-   salt & pepper to taste
-   paprika

Prepare meat (brown sausage and cut into 1/2" pieces, or dice ham) and
grate cheese. Mix all ingredients with a wire whisk, beating eggs
separately first. Pour into a greased quiche dish or deep dish pie
plate. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake in 425 degree oven for 30 minutes.

Serves 4-6.
