  Very excellent recipe which
Becky loves. Also apparently this recipe is actually from Grandmother,
and it is actually for making spare ribs, but we never did it that way.

-   2 lbs. thick bone in, or boneless pork chops (6 chops)
-   1 cup sliced onion
-   1 cup ketchup
-   1 cup water
-   2 teaspoons salt
-   1/4 cup cider vinegar
-   1/4 cup brown sugar
-   2 tablespoons Worcestershire
-   2 teaspoons dry mustard
-   1 teaspoon paprika

Remove all fat from pork chops, and place in 9" square pan. Combine
remaining ingredients and pour over pork chops (goal is to cover meat
with sauce). Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours.

Serves 6 people.

Serve with white rice, steamed apples, and a green vegetable.

Note: pineapple chunks may be added to sauce.
