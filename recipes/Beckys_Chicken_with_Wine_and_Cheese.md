  This recipe
comes from when the youth group helped make dinner for a Dinner Theater
thing at the Calvary United Methodist Church. Andrew, you really like
this chicken too.

-   6 boneless chicken breasts
-   3 slices of American cheese
-   1 (11 oz) can cream of chicken (or celery or mushroom) soup
-   1/2 cup white zinfandel wine
-   1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
-   4 tablespoons butter or margarine

Place chicken breasts in 9" x 9" baking pan. Put 1/2 slice of cheese on
each breast. Mix chicken soup with wine, and pour over chicken. Sprinkle
bread crumbs over the top. Pour melted butter over bread crumbs. Bake
for 1 hour at 350 degrees.

Serves 6 people.
