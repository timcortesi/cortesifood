 Very, very excellent chicken!
Better than Applebee's! Everyone loves this. (Also known as Tim and
Stacy's [Engagement
Chicken](http://cortesifood.com/wiki/Engagement_Chicken_(Chicken_with_Soup_%26_Rice)))

-   1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts

Marinade:

-   3 garlic cloves, minced
-   Juice of 2 limes (1/4 cup)
-   1/3 cup soy sauce
-   3 tablespoons tequila (optional)
-   1 tablespoon brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon onion salt
-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Salsa Dressing:

-   1/4 cup sour cream
-   2 tablespoons mayonnaise
-   2 tablespoons chunky salsa
-   1/2 teaspoon Cajun spice
-   1 dash dried dill weed
-   1 dash cumin
-   1 cup shredded Colby jack cheese
-   2 cups crumbled tortilla chips

Mix marinade from garlic, lime juice, soy sauce, tequila, brown sugar,
onion salt, and pepper. Cut chicken into 6 pieces, and marinade it in a
zip-lock bag at least 4 hours or overnight. Whisk together sour cream,
mayo, salsa, Cajun spice, dill weed, and cumin. Refrigerate whisked
salsa dressing until needed, at least 1 hour. Grill marinated chicken
breasts over a medium flame (or in a frying pan) about 8 minutes on each
side, until done. Place cooked chicken on a broiler pan (or 9"x9" square
pan), spread salsa dressing over each breast and sprinkle with cheese.
Broil until cheese has melted and browned slightly. Serve chicken on a
bed of crumbled chips with an optional lime wedge.

Add Spanish/Fiesta rice and chunky salsa on the side for a meal.

Serves 5-6
