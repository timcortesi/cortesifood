 This is the standard
chocolate chip cookie recipe from the chocolate chip bag, but it makes
really good cookies (and this is what we always used to make them when
we were growing up), so I am putting it in this book.

-   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 cup (2 sticks) butter/margarine, softened
-   3/4 cup granulated white sugar
-   3/4 cup packed brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   2 eggs
-   2 cups (12 oz. package) chocolate chips
-   1 cup chopped walnuts

Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat
butter/margarine, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla in large
mixer bowl until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each
addition; gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and
nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoon onto greased cookie sheets.

Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 9-11 minutes or until golden
brown. Let stand for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Pan cookie variation: Grease 9 x 13" pan. Spread batter in pan. Bake at
375 for 25-30 min until golden brown, and center is set. When completely
cool, cut like brownies.
