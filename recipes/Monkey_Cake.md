 This is
the breakfast "cake" that you pull apart with your fingers to eat.
Andrew, the bundt pan is the weird looking pan with the hole in the
middle of it.

-   4 packages refrigerated buttermilk biscuits, divided
-   1 cup sugar
-   1 tablespoon cinnamon
-   5 1/4 tablespoons margarine
-   1/2 cup chopped pecans
-   Raisins

Cut biscuits into quarters, 1 can at a time, and then roll each piece in
mixture of sugar and cinnamon. Grease the bundt pan and sprinkle some
nuts and raisins in the bottom of the pan. Cover the bottom with 1 pkg
of cinnamon-sugar coated biscuit pieces, and then sprinkle in more nuts
and raisins. Continue layering biscuit pieces, (1 pkg per layer), nuts,
and raisins until done. Melt margarine and drizzle over cake. Sprinkle
any remaining sugar/cinnamon mixture over cake. Bake at 350 degrees for
40-45 minutes. Invert immediately onto plate (be careful of hot syrup
surrounding cake). Cool and pull apart with fingers to serve.
