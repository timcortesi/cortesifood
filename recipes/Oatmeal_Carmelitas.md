These bars were Uncle Peter's favorite when we used to send him food
while he was in college. They mail well (and don't crumble).

Crust:

-   2 cups flour
-   2 cups oats
-   1 1/2 cups brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 1/4 cups margarine

Filling:

-   6 oz. package chocolate chips (1 cup)
-   1/2 cup chopped nuts
-   12 oz. jar caramel ice cream topping
-   3 tablespoons flour

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9" x 13" pan. In large bowl, mix crust
ingredients at low speed until crumbly. Press 1/2 mixture (about 3 cups)
into pan (not easy, but SO worth it). Bake 12 minutes. Sprinkle warm
base with chocolate chips and nuts. Combine caramel topping and 3
tablespoons flour, and drizzle over chocolate chips and nuts. Evenly
distribute remaining 'crust' on top using flattened spoonfuls. Return to
oven and bake 20-25 minutes, until golden. Cool completely. Cut into
bars.

Makes 36 bars.
