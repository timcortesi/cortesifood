This cake is very easy to make, but always looks very impressive (and
tastes very good). It is essentially a chocolate cake with layers of
whipped cream and cherries.

-   1 chocolate cake mix with pudding (preferably Duncan Hines Pudding
    Recipe Devil's Food)
-   1 container (8 oz.) frozen whipped topping, thawed
-   1 can (21 oz.) cherry pie filling

Mix and bake cake as directed on package in greased and floured 10" tube
pan at 350 degrees. Cool. Split cake into 3 layers. Spread 1/3 of
whipped topping, then 1/3 of pie filling between each layer, and top.
Chill until set.
