The most important part of this recipe is to make sure that you have the
grown-up assistant.

-   3 green onions (scallions)
-   1 pound hamburger meat
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   2 tablespoons mustard
-   1/4 cup ketchup
-   4 hamburger buns
-   1 adult helper

Wash and chop the green onions (you don't need to chop the green part if
you don't want). Put the hamburger meat in the frying pan, add the
chopped-up onions, and cook over low heat until brown. Have your
grown-up assistant come over to help spoon the fat into an empty jar or
milk carton. Add the other ingredients (except the hamburger buns), and
simmer for a few minutes. Spoon onto your hamburger buns and serve with
seasoned curly fries, baby carrots and milk.

Serves 4.
