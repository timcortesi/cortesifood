always have on Halloween and Christmas Eve. You should make some corn
bread to go along with it (just follow the instructions on the Jiffy
box).

-   1 can (16 oz.) black beans
-   1 1/2 lb. chopped meat
-   1 large onion, minced
-   1 quart tomatoes
-   1 green pepper
-   2 teaspoons chili powder
-   1 teaspoon salt

Brown meat, onion, and garlic. Add tomatoes, pepper, celery, chili
powder, and salt. Add beans and simmer about 30 minutes.
