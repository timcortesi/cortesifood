-   1 can (15 oz.) tomato sauce
-   3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (3 oz.)

Cut thin slice from stem end of each bell pepper to remove top of
pepper. Remove sees and membranes; rinse peppers. Cook peppers in enough

Cook beef and onion in 10" skilled over medium heat 8-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until beef is brown; drain. Stir in rice, salt,

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Stuff peppers with beef mixture. Stand peppers
