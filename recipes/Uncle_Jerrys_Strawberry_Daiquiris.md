staple!

-   6 oz. frozen lemonade
-   6 oz. orange juice (regular, not frozen, but if you can't wait to
    defrost and reconstitute, just estimate about a spoonful and add 5-6
    oz. of water)
-   6 oz. rum, or water for virgin daiquiris
-   1/2 bag (abt 8 oz or 1 cup) frozen strawberries (or more, especially
    if they are store bought and don't have a lot of color or flavor)
-   Ice (about same quantity as strawberries, maybe more)

Put all ingredients in blender and blend (add ice, and water if needed,
until blender vortex disappears). Serve in tulip-shaped stemmed glasses
with whipped cream and a fresh strawberry as garnish, if you are feeling
fancy, or the traditional CIL plastic cups if you are serving a thirsty
crowd. Enjoy!

This recipe fills about 8 CIL sized plastic cups.
