  Really good,
but you have to make sure to chop up the rosemary very finely (Dad!)
otherwise it looks like a pine tree.

-   1 1/2 lbs. pork tenderloin
-   3 cloves garlic
-   1 package fresh rosemary
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon pepper
-   2 Tbl olive oil
-   1 cup (8 oz) white wine
-   1 cup (8 oz) chicken broth

Peel garlic and slice into paper thin slivers. Cut deep slits all over
the pork and insert a sliver into each. Remove needles from 4 sprigs
rosemary and chop needles as finely as possible. Mix chopped rosemary
with salt and pepper, and rub rosemary mix all over pork. Heat oil in
large frying pan, and add pork. Cook until brown on each side. Remove
pork from heat to baking dish, and add wine and chicken broth. Cover pan
with foil and bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Let meat sit for 5
minutes after removing from oven. Slice and serve.

Suggested side dishes: Pesto Baked Tomatoes, couscous, and sliced
baguette.

Serves 4-5
