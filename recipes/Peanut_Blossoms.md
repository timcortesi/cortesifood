-   1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
-   1/2 cup margarine
-   1/2 cup extra crunchy peanut butter
-   2 tablespoons milk

-   1 3/4 cup flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   Additional sugar (to roll cookie balls in)
-   About 3 1/2 dozen dark chocolate Hershey kisses

Heat oven to 375 degrees. In large bowl, cream sugar, brown sugar, and
margarine/butter. Blend in peanut butter, milk, vanilla and egg. Stir in
flour, baking soda, and salt. Shape dough into 1" balls. Place 2" apart
on ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees for 10-12 minutes, or
