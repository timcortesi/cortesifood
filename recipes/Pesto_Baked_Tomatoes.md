 This recipe comes from the
green "Win Her With Dinner" book. It is good for making with the
Rosemary Pork (in the Main Dishes section). Pita, make sure you cut the
tomatoes in half lengthwise.

-   4 RIPE plum (Roma) tomatoes
-   1 container (4 oz.) prepared pesto (or 3 pesto 'ice cubes')
-   1/4 - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Rinse the tomatoes and slice them in half lengthwise. Scoop out and
discard half of the insides. Fill each tomato with pesto, top with
Parmesan, and put face up in small baking dish or pie plate. Bake in 400
degree oven for 10 minutes.

Serves 4.
