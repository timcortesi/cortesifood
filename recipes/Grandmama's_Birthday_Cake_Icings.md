These are icings (both for the base and to make the flowers, when we
used to do that) for Grandmama's birthday cake. (The cake and filling
recipes are on the previous page.)

Butter Cream Icing:

-   3 cups confectioners sugar
-   1/3 cup margarine
-   4 tablespoons marshmallow fluff
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   Milk

Beat butter and sugar together. Add marshmallow fluff and vanilla. Add
enough milk (1 tablespoon at a time) for creamy frosting.

Posey Cream Icing:

-   1 cup vegetable shortening
-   1 lb. (4 cups) confectioners sugar
-   1/4 cup margarine
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   1/8 teaspoon salt
-   Food coloring

Beat shortening, salt, and part of the sugar together. Add the rest of
the sugar, margarine, and flavoring. Divide into separate dishes and add
coloring 2 drops at a time; stir.
