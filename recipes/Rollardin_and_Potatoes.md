Very excellent German dish. Don't eat the strings.

-   Bracoile (\~1 pound) -- see note below
-   1 medium onion, finely diced
-   4 slices of bacon, uncooked
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   4 potatoes, cut into bite sized pieces

Cut meat into sections approximately 4" x 6". Cut each slice of bacon in
half and put two halves on each piece of meat. Cover bacon with onions
and salt and pepper to taste. Roll up and tie with 2-3 strings (use
"kitchen string" or kite string). Brown in vegetable oil, and cook up to
2 hours in 1" water. After meat has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours, add
potatoes to water to cook for remaining 30 minutes.

Serves 4.

Note:If you cannot find Bracoile, have a round steak cut 1/8-1/4" thick.
