Prep Time: 15 minutes Cook Time: 15 minutes Total Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients:

-   12 corn tortillas
-   1 28oz can of red enchilada sauce
-   2 cups (16 oz) mozzarella or queso blanco
-   1 1/2 cups meat (optional) shredded beef or chicken
-   2-3 tablespoons oil

Preparation:

Coat each tortilla with oil using your hands or a brush. Spread out on a
cookie sheet or baking dish and bake in a 500 degree oven for about 7
minutes. Take out to cool until they are warm to the touch. The cheese
can be shredded, or just cut into slices 3-4 inches long, and 1/4 inch
thick. (Or thicker if you like them really cheesy.)

Pour just enough sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 glass baking dish to
cover the it. Pour the rest of the sauce in a large bowl. Dip tortillas,
one at a time, in the bowl to coat with sauce.

Lay the tortilla in baking dish and if you're using the meat, put in
about 2-3 tablespoons. Place the cheese on top of the meat. Fold one
edge over the cheese, then the other one, then turn the whole thing
over, folded side down, in baking dish. Repeat for each tortilla.
Sprinkle any leftover sauce and/or cheese on top of enchiladas.

Place in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted.
