These are not actually kabobs, they are actually chicken and split pea
patties. Serve with version 1 of Fehma's rice (instructions earlier in
chapter).

-   1 lb. yellow split peas
-   3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
-   3 small long green chili peppers, diced
-   1 large onion, diced
-   1 teaspoon garam masala
-   1 teaspoon red chili pepper powder
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   2 eggs, beaten
-   Olive oil

Cover split peas with water in large pot and boil until soft
(approximately 30 minutes). Meanwhile, cook chicken in oil (a couple
tablespoons) until done. When both peas and chicken are cooked, combine
together and mash with a potato masher to make a thick paste. Add the
chili peppers and the onion to pea/chicken paste. Add garam masala, red
chili pepper powder, and salt. Form into 2‚Äù round patties (make sure to
press together firmly to prevent patty from falling apart). Add a small
amount of water to eggs; dip each patty into the egg wash mixture before
frying, to just barely coat patty. Heat approx 1/4 cup of oil in a
frying pan; fry each patty until golden brown, turning once.
