Dad really loves this chicken pot pie (and Tyler, you will note that it
is an actual pie and not a chicken stew with some noodles).

Filling:

-   1/3 cup margarine or butter
-   1/3 cup all-purpose flour
-   1 medium chopped onion
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon pepper
-   1 3/4 cups chicken or turkey broth (14.5 oz can)
-   2/3 cup milk
-   4 cups cut up cooked chicken (or turkey)
-   3 cups (10 oz.) frozen mixed vegetables

Celery Seed Pastry:

-   2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons margarine/butter
-   2 cups all-purpose flour
-   2 teaspoons celery seed
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   4-5 tablespoons water

In 3 qt. sauce pot, heat margarine over low heat until melted. Blend in
flour, onion, salt and pepper with wire whisk. Cook over low heat,
stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth and bubbly; remove from
heat. Whisk in broth and milk. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly.

Boil and stir 1 minute. Stir in chicken and frozen vegetables. Remove
from heat. Set aside.

Make Celery Seed Pastry: Cut mrgarine/butter into flour, celery seed and
salt, until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle in water, 1
tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and
pastry almost cleans side of bowl. Gather pastry into ball. Roll 2/3 of
pastry into circle on lightly floured board and ease pastry into 10"
deep dish pie pan. Roll remaining dough into circle for top crust.

Pour chicken filling into pastry lined pan. Place top pastry over
filling. Roll edges under; flute. Cut slits in center to allow steam to
escape. Cook uncovered at 425 degrees until crust is golden, 30-35
minutes.

Serves 6.
