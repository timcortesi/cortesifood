 Good for picnics and summer
dinners.

-   6 eggs
-   Water
-   1/3 cup mayo
-   1 1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar
-   Paprika

Hard boil eggs: gently place eggs directly from refrigerator into
saucepan and cover with cold water.  Cover, put pan on medium high heat,
and bring to a boil.  As soon as the water boils, turn heat down to low,
and simmer for 11 minutes.  When eggs are done, immediately pour out hot
water and run cold water over eggs constantly until eggs are cool.
 (Mark with a pencil to distinguish from non-cooked eggs in the
refrigerator if not using all of them).  Note - it is best to not use
fresh eggs, as fresh eggs are harder to peel. Gently tap hardboiled eggs
on counter to crack shell; remove shell and rinse eggs. Cut eggs in half
lengthwise, and remove all yolks into small mixing bowl. Set aside egg
whites. Mix yolks with mayo and vinegar. Spoon small amounts of yolk
mixture back into egg whites; sprinkle all with paprika.

Serves 6.
