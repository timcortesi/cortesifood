In order to make these "cookies" (really delicate, crispy fried dough),
you will need an iron thing. I'm not sure where Mom got hers so you will
have to ask her.

-   1 large egg
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 heaping teaspoon sugar
-   1/2 tsp. vanilla
-   1 cup flour
-   1 cup whole milk OR 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup water

Mix all ingredients together except flour. Add flour. Dip irons in hot
cooking fat, then momentarily in batter, then back in fat, until golden
brown. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
