This dessert consists of a cake, covered with fresh fruit (usually
peaches or apples, but can be other fruit, like blueberries, or sliced
plums). Catherine was Granddaddy's first cousin.

-   1 cup sugar
-   1/2 cup margarine
-   2 eggs
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   2 cups flour
-   1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-   Dash salt
-   1/2 cup milk
-   5 cups sliced peaches (abt 8) OR 9 medium apples; peeled, cored and
    sliced
-   Additional sugar, cinnamon, and butter (for topping)

Combine all ingredients except fruit and topping ingredients, and pour
into greased 9x13" pan (or two 8x8" pans). Top with fruit (stand slices
on edge. NOTE - do not press into batter). Sprinkle additional sugar and
cinnamon on fruit, and add a few dots of butter. Bake for 50 - 55
minutes at 350 degrees, until crust is golden at the edges.

This cake can also be topped with other fruit. To top with blueberries,
lower milk to 1/3 cup and sugar to 3/4 cup.
