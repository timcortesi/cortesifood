 I really like these
cookies, but they are a bit tricky to make because the dough is always
so sticky.

-   2 3/4 cups flour (may need extra if sticky)
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-   1 1/2 cups sugar
-   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) margarine
-   2 eggs
-   1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
-   6-7 drops yellow food color
-   Empty thread spool

Mix flour, salt, and baking powder. Beat 1 cup of the sugar and the
margarine in a large bowl with electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in
eggs, lemon rind, lemon juice, lemon extract, and 3-4 drops yellow food
color. On low speed, gradually beat in flour mixture. Chill 1 hour.

Heat oven to 400 degrees, and grease cookie sheets. Stir together the
remaining 1/2 cup sugar and 3 drops yellow food color until uniform.
Form dough into small balls the size of a small walnut. Roll in colored
sugar. Place about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Press flat
(only a little larger than spool) with the bottom of a glass. Press
spool about halfway into each cookie center. Bake 8 minutes or until a
light golden color, and cool on wire racks.

Makes about 48 cookies.
