Marion made this for us when we were in Rhode Island visiting their
family. Also you have to catch approximately 9838923 crabs to make 2
cups of crabmeat.

-   2 cups crabmeat
-   1 cup breadcrumbs
-   1 slightly beaten egg
-   1/4 cup minced celery
-   1/4 cup minced green pepper
-   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
-   Sprinkle of black pepper
-   Dash Tabasco sauce (to taste)
-   1 cup whipping cream

Mix together and stuff 12 crab shells. Bake at 375 degrees for 12
minutes.

Serves 6.
