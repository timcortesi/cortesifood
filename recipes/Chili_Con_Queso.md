Andrew: this is chili with cheese. You eat it as a warm dip with chips.

-   1 cup finely chopped onion
-   3 cloves garlic, crushed
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   2 teaspoons oil or bacon grease
-   1 small jar pimento (drained, deseeded, chopped)
-   1 1/2 cup tomatoes (1 1/2 tomatoes), drained and chopped (save
    juice)
-   1 small (4oz) can green chilies (drained, deseeded and chopped)
-   Freshly ground pepper
-   1 lb. Velveeta, cubed
-   12 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Saute onion and garlic in oil. Add chilies and stir. Add seasonings,
tomatoes, and pimento, and simmer gently until blended. Add cheese a
little at a time, and blend until melted. Add a little tomato juice if
needed, to thin for a hot dip.

Serve with corn tortilla chips.

Makes abt. 4 cups
