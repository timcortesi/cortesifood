Good Fehma bread, pronounced "row-tee".

-   2 1/2 cups flour (whole wheat)
-   Water as needed

Note: it is preferable to use 1-day-old dough (keep in fridge prior to
use.

Mix flour with enough water to make doughy (be careful not to add too
much flour to dough or bread will be too dry). Put dough mixture in
bowl, wet top, cover with saran wrap and put in freezer while making
chicken / rice.

Remove dough from freezer and roll thin (1/8"). Put flat 6‚Äù pancake in
frying pan with small amount of pam cooking spray. Cook until done on
one side (approx. 20 seconds) and then flip over; cook on other side.
Slide bread halfway out of pan and hold bread over burner to let it dry
and bubble. Repeat on other end. Continue until dough is gone.
