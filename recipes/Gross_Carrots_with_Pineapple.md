 These are the carrots that I
do not love. Kristamarie used to eat them for me in exchange for me
eating her mashed potatoes.

-   2 lbs. carrots, julienned (cut into thin strips, 2" long)
-   2 cans (8 oz.) crushed pineapple
-   1 tablespoon corn starch

Cook or steam carrots until done. Mix pineapple and corn starch in
saucepan, and heat to bubbling (stirring constantly). Cook 2-3 minutes
until clear. Pour over carrots and serve, but not to Becky.
