 Very good bar cookie.
Similar to [Dump Cake](Dump_Cake) only with oatmeal.

-   1 package white or yellow cake mix
-   1 1/4 cups rolled oats
-   1/2 cup margarine or butter, softened
-   1 egg
-   1 can (21 oz.) cherry fruit pie filling
-   1/2 cup chopped nuts
-   1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9x13" pan. In large bowl, combine cake
mix, 6 tablespoons of the margarine, and 1 cup of the rolled oats. Mix
until crumbly. Reserve 1 cup crumbs for topping. To remaining crumbs,
add 1 egg; mix until well blended. Press into greased pan. Pour cherry
pie filling over crust; spread to cover. To reserved crumbs, in large
bowl, add remaining 1/4 cup rolled oats, 2 tablespoons margarine, nuts
and brown sugar. Beat until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle over cherry
mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool completely. If desired, serve with a dollop of whipped cream.

Makes 12 servings.
