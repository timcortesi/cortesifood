Sweet-Sour Dressing

-   1/4 cup vegetable oil

-   1 Tbl snipped parsley
-   1/2 tsp salt

Cook almonds and sugar over low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar
is melted and almonds are coated. Cool and break apart. Store at room
temperature. (May want to make extra - they're super good for snacking!)

Place lettuce and romaine in a gallon zip lock bag; add celery and
onions. Combine all Sweet-Sour Dressing ingredients in a tightly covered
jar; shake vigorously. Pour dressing into salad bag; add orange
segments. Close bag tightly and shake until salad greens and orange
segments are well coated. Add almonds and shake.

For added crunch, sprinkle on chow mein noodles just before serving.

For a dinner, boil chicken breasts for abt 10 min; cool; cut into 1/2"
pieces. Add to salad.

Serves 4-6
