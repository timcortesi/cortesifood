 Tim says pretty much just
throw stuff in until it tastes good. With that said, here is a guess at
a recipe.

-   1 cup frozen strawberries
-   1 medium banana, cut into chunks
-   1 handful of ice
-   About 1/4 cup orange juice

Put all ingredients in blender. Cover and blend on high speed about 30
seconds or until smooth. Pour mixture into 3 glasses.

Notes: Apple Juice works as a good base instead of OJ. You also might
want to try raspberries, peaches, blueberries, or any other fruit you
have available.

Serves 3.
