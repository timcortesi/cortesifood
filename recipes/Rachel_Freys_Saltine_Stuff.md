This recipe comes from Becky's college friend Rachel. It is a really
good snack.

-   1 sleeve saltines
-   1/2 cup brown sugar
-   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
-   1 bag chocolate chips
-   Toppings of your choosing, for example: coconut, sprinkles, crushed
    peppermint, nuts, or toffee (heath) bits

Line a baking sheet with tin foil & spray with Pam. Line with saltines
so that they are touching & flat; break edge crackers as needed to cover
the entire sheet. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Melt brown sugar &
butter in small saucepan, stirring constantly until smooth. Pour over
the saltine mixture (it won't totally cover everything). Bake for 7
minutes. Remove from oven & sprinkle chocolate chips over the top. Let
sit for 1 minute and spread with spatula. Sprinkle with toppings as
desired. Refrigerate and let cool. Break into pieces; can store in a
plastic bag.
