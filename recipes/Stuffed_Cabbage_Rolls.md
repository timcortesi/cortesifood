  A really good dinner.
Kinda' labor intensive, removing the cabbage leaves from the head, but
really worth it.

-   1 large head of cabbage, yielding 8-12 cabbage leaves
-   1 pound hamburger
-   1/2 cup uncooked instant rice
-   1/8 teaspoon garlic salt
-   1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce, divided
-   1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
-   1 medium onion, chopped (abt. 1/2 cup)
-   1 can (4 oz.) mushroom stems and pieces, undrained
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/8 teaspoon pepper
-   1 teaspoon sugar
-   1 tablespoon cornstarch
-   1 tablespoon water

Separate 8-12 leaves from cabbage (Remove core with pointed knife;
plunge whole cabbage into boiling water for 30 sec; remove, gently
loosen and peel off whatever outside leaves you can. Put cabbage back
into the boiling water and repeat until you have enough leaves). Cover
leaves with boiling water; cover and let stand 10 minutes until leaves
are limp; drain. Mix hamburger, rice, onion, mushrooms, salt, pepper,
garlic salt, and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce. Place 1/3 cup hamburger
mixture at stem end of each leaf (a little more in larger leaves). Roll
leaf around mixture, tucking in sides. Place cabbage rolls seam sides
down in ungreased 8x8" baking dish. Mix remaining tomato sauce, sugar,
and lemon juice; pour over cabbage rolls. Cover and cook at 350 degrees
until hamburger is done, about 45 minutes. Mix cornstarch and 1
tablespoon water in saucepan. Stir in liquid from cabbage rolls. Heat to
boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Serve sauce with
cabbage rolls.

Serve with a green salad.

Makes 8-12 rolls (6 servings).
