  I think we had this when we
were at Aunt Rene's for Thanksgiving one year. Neither Mom nor I
actually remember eating it, but the recipe card says "Excellent" so
hopefully it is. Note from Mom: I made it and it is really good!

-   1 bag tater tots (26 oz. - 1 1/2+ lbs.)
-   1 onion, chopped
-   8 oz. (1 cup) sour cream
-   1 can cream soup (celery, mushroom, chicken...)
-   2 cups (abt. 6 1/2 oz) shredded cheddar cheese
-   1 lb. (2 cups) frozen green beans
-   1/2 stick (melted) margarine

Pour green beans into greased 9x13" pan. Sprinkle with onions. Combine
sour cream & soup in a bowl and distribute spoonfuls on top of onions.
Cover with tater tots & sprinkle with shredded cheese. Pour melted
margarine on top. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.

Serves 8
