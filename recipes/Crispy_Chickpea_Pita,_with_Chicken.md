 This recipe is from Real Simple
and Rachel and I really love it. It didn't have any meat in the recipe,
so we added chicken for Tim.

-   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
-   2 15.5-ounce cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
-   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
-   1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped, plus 1/2 cup whole
    parsley leaves
-   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided
-   4 plum tomatoes, diced
-   4 pitas or pieces flat bread, warmed
-   1 8-ounce container hummus
-   2 chicken breasts, cooked and sliced, (optional)
-   1 small red onion, thinly sliced
-   1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco)
-   1/2 cup plain yogurt
-   1 lemon, cut into wedges

Chickpea mixture: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the chickpeas and cook, stirring occasionally,
until slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add the lemon
juice, chopped parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of
the pepper and toss with the chickpeas. Parsley Salad: In a small bowl,
combine the whole parsley leaves, tomatoes, and the remaining oil, salt,
and pepper. Assemble: Divide the warm pitas or flat bread among
individual plates and spread with the hummus. Top with the chickpeas,
chicken (optional), onion, and hot sauce. Serve with the parsley salad,
dollop of yogurt, and lemon wedges.

Serves 4.
