 This
gingerbread and apple "slop" is great to make over a camp fire.

-   1 14.5 oz. box gingerbread mix
-   Ingredients to prepare gingerbread mix as usual (egg, water)
-   48 oz. jar of applesauce or 5 cups homemade

Prepare gingerbread mix, following directions on box, using a wire
whisk. Pour applesauce into the bottom of a large ungreased 6 qt. pot
(Dutch oven). Applesauce will be about 2" deep. Pour prepared
gingerbread batter over applesauce. Cover pot, and cook on medium, then
med-low heat until applesauce boils and cake is done (about 25 minutes
on a stove, but it will depend on how hot the camp fire is). Do not
stir. Serve warm (with ice cream or whipped cream if desired).

Serves 6-8.
