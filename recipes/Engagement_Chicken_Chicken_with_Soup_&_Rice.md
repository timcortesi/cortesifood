 This is a very easy
dish to make, but it still tastes very good. In fact it tastes so good
that sometimes if you make this chicken dinner for your boyfriend, he is
so impressed that he proposes! (For Stacy and Tim's Engagement Chicken,
check out [Fiesta Lime Chicken](Rachels_Fiesta_Lime_Chicken) )
Also, Andrew, this is the chicken that you really like.

-   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or 2 1/2 lbs skinless legs &
    thighs)
-   1 can cream of mushroom (or other, such as broccoli, celery, or
    chicken) soup
-   White rice

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put 4 chicken breasts into a square baking
pan, and pour soup all over the top of the chicken. Cook until done,
about 1 hour. Prepare rice (following package instructions) while
chicken is cooking. Serve; spoon sauce from chicken pan over rice. Serve
with broccoli or green beans and steamed apples.

Serves 4.
