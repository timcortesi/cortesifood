 Call up Dad and complain if this
doesn't taste right, because he says that he pretty much just makes up
the recipe as he goes. It's really good when he makes it, though.

-   1 16 oz. package kielbasa or other sausage
-   2-3 green peppers
-   1 onion
-   1/2 cup ketchup
-   1/4 cup brown sugar
-   1/4 cup mustard
-   1/2 cup water
-   1/2 cup barbeque sauce
-   5 'torpedo' or Portuguese rolls

Cut meat in 1/4" slices, and cut each slice in half. Cut peppers and
onions into large chunks. Cook all ingredients in large frying pan and
cook at medium heat for 15-20 minutes, until hot. Slice rolls sideways,
lengthwise, and use a fork to remove some of the soft bread from the
center. Set aside. Put a couple large spoonfuls of the sausage mixture
on one side of roll - fold top over to make sandwich. Serve with chips.

Serves about 5.
