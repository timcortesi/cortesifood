-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   Dash of salt
-   9 cups thinly sliced pared tart apples (requires about 9 medium
    apples)
-   2 tablespoons margarine or butter

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Prepare pastry. Mix sugar, flour, nutmeg,
cinnamon and salt. Stir in apples. Turn into pastry-lined 9" pie plate;
dot with margarine. Cover with top crust that has slits cut in it; seal

last 15 minutes of baking. Bake until crust is brown and juice begins to
bubble through slits in crust; 40 to 50 minutes.
