 Very good cookies
(except the nuts).

-   1 3/4 cups finely chopped pecans, divided
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 package (18 3/4 oz.) German chocolate cake mix with pudding
-   1/2 cup vegetable oil
-   2 large eggs, beaten
-   6 oz. semisweet chocolate chips (1 cup)
-   1 1/2 teaspoons hot water
-   70 pecan halves

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Have baking sheets ready. Combine 3/4 cup
chopped pecans and sugar. To make cookies, place cake mix in a large
bowl. Use mixer to beat in oil and eggs.  Add chocolate chips and
remaining 1 cup pecan pieces.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2"
apart onto baking sheets. Flatten each cookie lightly with the bottom of
a juice glass dipped in the sugar and nut mixture. Add hot water to the
remaining sugar-nut mixture. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the sugar-nut
topping over each cookie. Firmly press a pecan half in the center of
each. Bake 8-10 minutes until top is set. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Makes about 70 cookies.
