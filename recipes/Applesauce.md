Excellent fresh or frozen!

-   1/2 bushel apples (preferably a mix of varieties (MacIntosh,
    Cortland, Yellow Delicious, etc)
-   Approx. 1/2 cup apple juice/cider
-   Approx. 1 teaspoon cinnamon

If you have a food mill: Core and slice the apples and put into large
pots with just enough apple juice to keep apples from sticking to the
bottom as they begin to cook.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally from the bottom.  Apples are done when they are mushy and
bubbling.  Remove from heat.  Put large spoonfuls of the hot cooked
apples into the food mill (over large bowl), and turn handle to separate
skins from apple pulp.  Empty practically dry skins from the food mill
periodically.  Stir cinnamon into sauce to taste.

If you don't have a food mill: Peel apples before coring and slicing
apples as above.  Put into large pots with apple juice and cook and stir
as above.  When apples are mushy, remove pot from heat and stir in
cinnamon.
