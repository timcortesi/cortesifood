 This is a recipe
that Rachel found and says is good.

-   2 (10-ounce) portions frozen pizza dough, thawed
-   4 tomatoes, thinly sliced
-   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   1 cup shredded mozzarella
-   1/2 cup thinly sliced basil leaves

Arrange oven racks in the lower and upper third of the oven. Heat the
oven to 475 degrees. Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to
make two 12-inch rounds and transfer to two ungreased baking sheets (or
two 12-inch pizza pans). Arrange the tomatoes on top of the dough,
overlapping them slightly. Drizzle the pizza with oil and season well
with salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake pizzas for 10 minutes, remove
from the oven, top with the mozzarella and basil, and bake 5 minutes
longer, until the cheese melts and the edges of the pies are crisp and
lightly browned.

Serves 4.
