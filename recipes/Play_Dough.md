This is the kid's play dough recipe from the Klutz kids reciped book.

-   1 cup white flour
-   1/4 cup salt
-   2 tablespoons cream of tartar
-   1 cup water
-   2 teaspoons food coloring
-   1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Mix flour, salt and cream of tartar in a medium pot. Add water, food
coloring and oil. Stir over medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Don't worry if
the mixture looks like a globby mess; it'll turn into dough! When the
mixture forms a ball in the center of the pot, take it out and put it on
a floured surface. Squish it and punch it around a bit; this is called
kneading. When you are done, put it in a plastic bag or airtight
container and store it in the fridge.
