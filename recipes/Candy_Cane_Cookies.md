 This is Dad's favorite
cookie to make.

-   1 cup margarine
-   1 cup confectioner's sugar
-   1 egg
-   1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   2 1/2 cups flour
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon red food coloring

Cream margarine, confectioner's sugar, egg, almond extract, and vanilla.
Sift together flour and salt, and add to creamed mixture. Divide dough
in half, and blend red food coloring into half. Chill.

Roll 1 teaspoon of each portion of dough into 4" lengths. Lay next to
each other and twist like a rope, and shape like candy cane. Place on
greased cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes at 375 degrees.

Makes about 2 1/2 dozen large canes, or 5 dozen small canes.
