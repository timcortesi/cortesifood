Excellent - Grandmother used to make this for us for breakfast (and let
the dough rise on the radiator).

Dough:

-   1 package/envelope yeast
-   1/4 cup warm (105-115 degrees) water
-   3/4 cup lukewarm milk (scalded, then cooled)
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 cup sugar
-   1 egg
-   1/4 cup soft margarine/butter
-   4 cups flour, + 2 for kneading/rolling

Cinnamon-Raisin Filling:

-   4 tablespoons softened margarine/butter, divided btwn 2 rings
-   1/2 cup packed brown sugar, divided btwn 2 rings
-   2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided btwn 2 rings
-   1/2 cup raisins, divided btwn 2 rings

Glaze:

-   1 cup powdered sugar
-   1 tablespoon milk
-   1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Decoration:

-   24 pecan halves, divided btwn 2 rings
-   12 maraschino cherries, halved, divided btwn 2 rings

Dissolve yeast in warm water in lg bowl. Mix in milk, salt, sugar, egg
and margarine. Add 2 cups flour and blend together until smooth. Mix in
enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and
elastic (about 5 minutes), adding more of the flour as needed. Place in
bowl that has been greased with margarine, then turn greased side up.
Cover with damp cloth and let rise in warm place until doubled (about 1
1/2 - 2 hours). Punch dough down with floured fist and divide in half.

Roll half of the dough into a rectangle, 9" x 15", on a lightly floured
surface. Spread with margarine/butter, and sprinkle with brown sugar,
cinnamon and raisins. Roll up tightly, beginning at long side. Pinch
edge of dough into roll to seal well and stretch roll to make even. With
sealed edge down, shape into ring on lightly greased cookie sheet. Pinch
ends together. With scissors, make cuts 2/3 of the way through ring at
1" intervals. Turn each section on its side. Repeat above with remaining
half of the dough. Let rise until double, about 40 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake until golden brown, 25-30 minutes. (If
tea ring browns too quickly, cover loosely with aluminum foil.) Let
cool, then drizzle on glaze (below) and decorate with pecans and
cherries.

To make Glaze: Mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla until glaze is
smooth an of desired consistency.

Yield: 2 rings
