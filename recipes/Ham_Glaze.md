This (as the name implies) is the very good glaze that we make for
cooked ham. We used to have it on Easter.

-   3 cups apple juice
-   1/4 cup vinegar
-   1/2 cup brown sugar (maybe more)
-   1 can (8 oz.) crushed pineapple
-   1/2 cup raisins
-   2 tablespoons flour

Mix together cold, and add more brown sugar if not sweet enough. Heat
slowly stirring occasionally. If not thick enough, add flour mixed with
water or apple juice.

Serve on table with cooked ham.
