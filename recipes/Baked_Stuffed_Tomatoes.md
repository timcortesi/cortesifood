 Tim - there is not
any meat in this recipe either, so we added a little ground beef. Its a
REALLY good recipe (really)!

-   6 large ripe tomatoes
-   1 can cream of celery soup
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   1 onion, chopped
-   1/2 green pepper, chopped
-   1 stalk celery, chopped
-   2/3 cup bread crumbs or (cooked) rice
-   1/2 lb. ground beef, browned (optional)
-   Parmesan cheese

Cut slices from stem ends of tomatoes, scoop out centers and save for
stuffing. Pour soup into a 9" x 9" baking dish; set tomatoes in soup.
Sprinkle tomato cavities with salt and pepper.

Prepare stuffing: Cook chopped onion, green pepper, and celery in the
margarine for 5 minutes, or until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in
chopped tomato centers. Add bread crumbs/cooked rice and optional ground
beef.

Stuff tomato shells with stuffing, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.

Serve with white rice, a salad, and warmed Tuscan bread.

Serves 5 - 6.

For variation, try other vegetables as stuffing or additions to the
stuffing.
