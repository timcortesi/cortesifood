This was Dad's favorite when he used to work for Grandpop.

-   1 lb. dried navy or pea beans
-   Ham hocks
-   Onion, cut up
-   Carrots, cut up
-   Tomato (if desired)

Soak beans overnight. Cook next morning with ham hocks for about 1-2
hours. Add onion, carrots, and tomato (if using). Presumably then you
cook it some more and then eat it. Ask Mom for more details about this
recipe because this is all she gave me.
