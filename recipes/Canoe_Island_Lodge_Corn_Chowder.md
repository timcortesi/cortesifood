 This is the recipe that the chef
from CIL gave us. Mom loved it! I have no idea what "roux" is or how
exactly to make it, so you probably should look it up on Wikipedia.

-   8 oz. (1/2 lb.) raw bacon
-   1 medium onion, diced 1/8"
-   3 stalks celery, diced 1/8"
-   4 cups fresh cooked corn, cut from the cob
-   6 cups chicken or corn stock (for corn stock, boil corncobs for 2
    hours and strain)
-   1 teaspoon dry thyme
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
-   1 cup heavy cream
-   4 medium potatoes, peeled (or unpeeled red potatoes)and diced 1/4"

<!-- -->

-   Roux (thickening agent):
-   2 Tbl margarine
-   2 Tbl flour
-   1-2 Tbl milk
-   3/4 tsp salt
-   1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper

In heavy bottomed stockpot (or Dutch oven), saute bacon until crisp.
Remove bacon from pan and crumble btwn paper towels into small pieces.
Add onions and celery to the bacon fat in the pan, and saute until
onions are translucent. Add corn and stock and bring to boil. Lower heat
to a simmer and add seasonings. Simmer for 15-20 minutes. Add potatoes
and simmer until just soft (abt 15-20 min more). Add cream, return to
simmer. Make roux: in sm. saucepan over med heat, melt margarine. Whisk
in flour and add enough milk to make a creamy but thick mixture. Whisk
the roux into the soup while simmering. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve with crusty bread and butter.

Serves about 6 people.
