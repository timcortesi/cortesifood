Very good recipe for cooked pinto beans.

-   1 lb. pkg. dried pinto beans (picked clean, rinsed, and soaked
    overnight)
-   1 clove garlic, peeled, whole
-   1 teaspoon salt (optional)
-   6 oz. cold beer (non-alcoholic works too)
-   4 strips bacon, sliced thin
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   1/2 bunch fresh cilantro - about 2 cups
-   1 teaspoon cumin
-   1 teaspoon oregano
-   Pepper to taste

Drain beans from soaking water and cover by about 2" with fresh, cold
water. Bring to a low boil, stirring occasionally - scoop out the froth.
At the same time heat a kettle of water to replenish the beans, as
needed. When reaching low boil, add salt only and lower heat to keep at
simmer. Usually about 2-3 hours. After you lower the heat, add beer and
just maintain water to cover the beans. When you blow on beans in a
spoon the skin will curl back when ready for next step. In separate
frying pan (cast iron is best) fry up chopped bacon with onion. When
onion is clear, add chopped cilantro. Saute until bacon is crisp. Add
all, even bacon drippings, to beans. Stir together bacon mix and beans
over simmer for about 1/2 hour before adding seasonings. Great if
reheated. Easy to mash down and add cheese and salsa for burritos or
dipping.
