I don't actually know if this recipe is good or not but it was in Mom's
recipe box so I put it in here.

-   1 can cream of mushroom soup
-   2 cans cream of celery soup
-   1 package onion soup mix
-   1 1/2 cup rice
-   2 cups milk
-   4 cups leftover turkey
-   1 cup celery, chopped
-   1 cup celery, chopped
-   1/4 cup bread crumb

Combine all ingredients in a large casserole dish. Bake covered at 350
degrees for 1 hour.
