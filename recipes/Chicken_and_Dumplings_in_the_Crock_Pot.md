 This is another Cortesi
family staple and very good.

-   3 medium potatoes, cut in 1/4" slices
-   3 carrots (or 10-12 baby carrots), cut in 3/4" pieces
-   1 (2 1/2) broiler/fryer chicken, skinned and cut in serving size
    pieces (OR 6 thighs, skinned)
-   1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
-   2 teaspoons salt
-   1/2 teaspoon celery seed
-   1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
-   1 can mushroom soup
-   Water
-   1 can (8 oz.) refrigerator biscuits\*

Place first 8 ingredients in Crock Pot in the order they appear in the
ingredients list. Pour in mushroom soup. Refill soup can with water 1
1/2 times, and pour in over soup. Cover and cook 7 to 9 hours on low, or
4 1/2 to 5 hours on high. Drain chicken and vegetables (keep broth!);
place in bowl, cover to keep warm. Pour broth into dutch oven (lg 6 qt
