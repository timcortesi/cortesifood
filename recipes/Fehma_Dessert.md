I don't think I remember having this, but it is in Mom's collection of
Fehma's recipes, so here it is.

-   1/2 cup slivered almonds
-   2 eggs, beaten
-   1 cup milk
-   1 cup sugar
-   1/2 cup olive oil
-   1 cup Sooji powder (wheat?) (looks like farina)
-   1/2 cup raisins

Cover almonds with water in saucepan and boil for 10 min. Drain. Set
aside.

Mix together eggs, milk and sugar.

Put olive oil into 3 quart saucepan. Add Sooji powder. Let simmer until
golden brown. Add milk mixture from above, stirring constantly.

Wash 1/2 cup raisins in warm water, then add to above with almonds.

Serve.
