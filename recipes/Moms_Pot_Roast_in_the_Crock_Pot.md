  Easy and
yummy. Especially with egg noodles.

-   3-4 medium potatoes, unpeeled, cut in 1/4" slices
-   3 carrots, cut in 2" pieces
-   3 small onions, cut in 1/4" slices
-   1 (4 lb.) bottom round or rump roast
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/8 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
-   1 can (10 1/2 oz.) condensed beef broth

Place all ingredients in Crock Pot, in order listed. Cover. Turn heat
control to low; cook 8-10 hours or until meat is done. Remove meat and
vegetables to platter, cover with foil, keep in a warm place. Thicken
remaining juices to make gravy.

Serve with egg noodles and a salad.
