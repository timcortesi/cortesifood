 Rachel got this recipe from
the Cabot cheese tasting booth at the NY State Fair (in the building
where the sand sculpture is). It is good.

-   1 Boboli thin crust (12")
-   1 can (16 oz.) black beans
-   1 cup cooked chicken breast
-   1 cup roasted corn tomato salsa
-   1 can (4 oz.) diced green chilies
-   1 cup shredded Pepper Jack cheese
-   1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, torn
-   Crushed red pepper flakes to taste

Drain black beans, reserving 4 tablespoons liquid. Puree 1 cup beans
with liquid in a food processor or blender and spread over pizza crust.
Evenly distribute remaining beans, chicken, salsa, and chilies over bean
puree. Sprinkle cheese evenly over pizza. Bake at 325 degrees until
cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10-12 minutes. Slice and serve
garnished with cilantro.
