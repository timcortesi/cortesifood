  Mom used to make these
when she was growing up on the farm. They are extra sweet if you use the
butterscotch chips option vs the peanut butter (peanut butter is
better!)

-   1/2 cup margarine, melted
-   1 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
-   1 bag chocolate chips (12 oz.)
-   1 cup butterscotch chips OR 1 1/2 cups melted peanut butter
-   1 1/2 cup coconut
-   1 can (14 oz.) sweetened condensed milk
-   1 1/2 cups chopped nuts

Layer all ingredients in a 9" x 13" pan, in order. Bake at 350 degrees
for 30 minutes. Cool before cutting.

Makes 36 bars.
