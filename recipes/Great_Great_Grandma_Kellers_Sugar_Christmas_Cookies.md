 These
are the cookie cutter cookies with the lemon icing that are really good.

Cookies:

-   1/2 lb. margarine (2 sticks)(1 cup)
-   1 cup sugar
-   3 eggs
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   3/4 teaspoon baking powder
-   4 cups flour (add more if sticky)

Icing:

-   2 cups confectioner sugar
-   1/4 tsp lemon extract
-   1/4 cup lemon juice (stirred in 1 tablespoon at a time)

Make cookies: Cream together margarine and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla,
mix. Add baking powder and mix. Slowly add flour while mixing.
Refrigerate. Roll out cookie dough 1/8-1/4" thick (using flour to keep
dough from sticking) and cut out cookies. Bake cookies at 375 degrees
for about 6-8 minutes - do not over bake. Cool cookies completely before
icing.

Make icing: Combine all icing ingredients and add more sugar / lemon
juice until desired consistency and flavor are achieved.
