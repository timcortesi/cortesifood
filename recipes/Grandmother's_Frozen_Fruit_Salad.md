 (Okay, only the grandchildren
actually don't like this. I think everyone else does.)

-   1 envelope unflavored gelatin
-   1/4 cup maraschino cherry juice
-   1 cup diced apricots
-   1 cup diced pineapple (14 oz)
-   1 cup halved, seeded grapes
-   1 cup chopped maraschino cherries (12 oz jar)
-   3 tablespoons lemon juice
-   1/2 cup sugar
-   1 cup heavy cream
-   2 cups colored mini marshmallows
-   1/2 cup mayonnaise

Soften gelatin in cherry juice in top of double boiler. Dissolve over
boiling water. Add fruits, lemon juice, sugar and marshmallows. Chill
until syrupy (no more than 1/2 hr).

Whip cream until light and fluffy. Stir in mayonnaise. Fold into fruit
mixture with a wooden spoon, using an over under motion. Spoon salad
into molds. (Use empty margarine tubs, 6 oz. tupperware jello molds,
etc.) Store in freezer.

Unmold salads on lettuce leaves 2 hours before serving. Run a knife
around each cup; press bottom to release salad. Chill until served.

Makes 8 servings.
