What is below is slightly modified (more peaches). Also FYI if you only
need to serve 4 you can can half the whole recipe and put it in an 8x8
pan.

-   1 8-oz. loaf French bread, sliced
-   8 large eggs
-   2 cups whole milk
-   1/4 cup sugar
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   40 oz. sliced peaches, drained if you are using canned peaches
-   1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
-   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1/2 cup heavy cream

Put pam in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange bread in a tight, flat
layer in dish. In a large bowl, whisk eggs with milk, sugar and vanilla
until blended; pour over bread. Arrange peaches on top and sprinkle with
brown sugar and cinnamon. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 8
hours. Remove baking dish from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Pour cream into a small pan; bring to a boil over
high heat. Cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Drizzle over
peaches and bake, uncovered, until casserole is lightly browned on top
and just cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes
before serving.
