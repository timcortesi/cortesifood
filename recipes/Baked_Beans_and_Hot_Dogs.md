 This meal is so simple
that it probably doesn't even need to have the recipe written down, but
I am including it anyway because it is something we used to make.

-   1 large can baked beans
-   6 hot dogs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Pour baked beans into 9" x 9" glass baking
dish, and place hot dogs on top of beans. Heat in oven until beans are
bubbly (maybe 15-20 minutes). Serve with sauerkraut, and hot dog rolls
or zucchini bread, if desired.

Serves 4-5.
