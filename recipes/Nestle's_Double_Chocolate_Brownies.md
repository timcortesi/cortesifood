  I think this
recipe was on the back of a chocolate chip bag at one point as well, but
it is now difficult to find. It makes brownies (from scratch) with
chocolate chips in them. Its REALLY good!

-   3/4 cup all purpose flour
-   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/3 cup butter
-   3/4 cup sugar
-   2 tablespoons water
-   1 12 oz. pkg (2 cups) chocolate chips, divided
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   2 eggs
-   1/2 cup chopped nuts
-   1/4 cup mini M&M's

Preheat oven to 325. In small bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt;
set aside. In small saucepan, combine butter, sugar and water; bring
just to a boil. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup chocolate chips and vanilla
extract. Stir until chips melt and mixture is smooth. Transfer to large
bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Gradually blend in flour mixture. Stir in remaining 1 cup chocolate
chips and nuts. Spread into greased 9" square baking pan. Sprinkle with
M&M's. Bake at 325 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Cool completely and cut
into 16 squares.
