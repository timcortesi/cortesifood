 Very excellent. I
also recommend adding large pieces of green peppers to the pan about 2
minutes before cooking is done.

-   1 rotisserie chicken (pre-cooked), cut into pieces

<!-- -->

-   1 box (10 oz.) couscous

<!-- -->

-   2 tsp. olive oil
-   1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced

<!-- -->

-   1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar
-   Pinch ground nutmeg
-   1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-   1/2 cup orange juice
-   1 can (15 oz.) diced peaches, drained

OR 1/2 qt. jar Mom's pickled peaches, drained

-   1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves (optional)
-   1/2 green pepper, cut in 1" pieces (optional)

Cook the couscous according to the box directions.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the
garlic and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Add the sugar, nutmeg, vinegar, and
orange juice and bring to a simmer. Add the peaches and continue to
simmer until the liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. -OR- Heat
oil and garlic, as above. Substitute 1/2 qt. jar of Mom's pickled
peaches for the next 5 ingredients. Simmer, as above. Add parsley and/or
green pepper, as desired.

Divide the couscous and chicken among individual bowls, top with the
peach mixture, and sprinkle with the parsley (if using).

Serves 4-6, depending on size of chicken
