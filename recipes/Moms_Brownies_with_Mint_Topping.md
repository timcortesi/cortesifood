  The
Andes mints melted on top of these brownies make them taste great!

-   1 box brownie mix
-   1 box (4.6 oz) Andes mints (28 pieces) OR
-   1 box (5 oz) Necco mints

Prepare brownie mix as directed on box. Spread in greased 9x13" pan, and
bake brownies 5 minutes less than directed in box instructions. Remove
brownies from oven and evenly distribute mints on top. Return to oven,
bake for remaining 5 minutes, and quickly spread melted mint chocolate
(while still warm) to evenly distribute across the top of the brownies.
Let brownies cool and serve with a glass of cold milk.
