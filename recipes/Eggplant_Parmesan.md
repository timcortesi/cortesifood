Probably this would taste better as chicken. I don't actually love
eggplant.

-   2 lbs. (about 2 large) eggplants
-   Salt to taste
-   1 can (32 oz.) whole peeled tomatoes
-   2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
-   Olive oil
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
-   1/2 cup fine dry breadcrumbs
-   7 large eggs, beaten
-   1 1/2 lbs. mozzarella cheese, sliced into 1/4" rounds
-   1 cup grated high quality Parmesan cheese
-   1 packed cup fresh basil leaves

Cut eggplants lengthwise into 1/4" slices. Arrange one layer in the
bottom of a large colander and sprinkle evenly and generously with salt.
Repeat with remaining eggplant, salting, until all eggplant is in the
colander. Weigh down the slices with a couple of plates and let drain
for 2 hours. The purpose of this step is to have the eggplant release
some of its moisture before cooking. While the eggplant is draining,
prepare tomato sauce. Combine tomatoes, garlic, and 1/3 cup olive oil in
a food processor. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.

When eggplant has drained, press down on it to remove excess water, and
lay the slices out on paper towels to remove all the moisture. In a
wide, shallow bowl, combine flour and breadcrumbs. Mix well. Pour beaten
eggs into another wide shallow bowl. Place a large, deep skillet over
medium heat, and pour in a half inch of olive oil. When oil is
simmering, dredge the eggplant slices first in the flour mixture, then
in the beaten egg. Working in batches, slide coated eggplant into hot
oil and fry until golden brown on both sides, turning once. Drain on
paper towels.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In the bottom of a 10x15" glass baking
dish, spread 1 cup of tomato sauce. Top with one third of the eggplant
slices. Top eggplant with half of the mozzarella slices. Sprinkle with
one third of the Parmesan and half of the basil leaves. Make a second
layer of eggplant slices, topped by 1 cup of sauce, remaining
mozzarella, half the remaining Parmesan, and all of the remaining basil.
Add remaining eggplant, and top with the remaining tomato sauce and
Parmesan.

Bake until cheese has melted and the top is slightly brown, about 30
minutes. Allow to rest at room temperature for about 10 minutes before
serving.

Serves 8.
