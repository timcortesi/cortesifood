 Super good, tangy and healthy!
Great make-ahead for a cool summer dinner.

-   1 head of green cabbage
-   1 1/2 lbs. boneless chicken breasts (4 1/2 breasts)
-   3 pkgs. top ramen chicken flavor noodle soup
-   1 pkg. (3.75 oz) salted sunflower seeds
-   1 pkg. (2 oz) slivered almonds
-   3 scallions
-   1 cup red or white wine vinegar (or champagne)
-   1/2 cup sugar
-   3/4 cup sesame oil

Cut up/shred cabbage and slice scallions. Boil chicken breasts about 10
minutes, then dice. Put cabbage, scallions, and chicken in a large bowl
(with lid). Fry sunflower seeds and almonds in a small amount of oil,
stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and pat on paper towel until all
dry. Pound packages of soup before opening, and remove all of the
seasoning packets. Pour noodles in the salad. Mix sesame oil, vinegar,
sugar and seasoning packets. Pour on salad immediately and mix well.
Best to make a day ahead.

Serves 6-8
