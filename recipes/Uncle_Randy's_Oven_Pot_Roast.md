Good, and an easy way to make a pot roast without cooking it all day in
the Crock Pot.

-   4 lb. rump roast or tenderloin
-   4 large cans of whole boiled potatoes
-   2 jar or cans (16 oz. each) of whole boiled onions
-   8 fresh carrots peeled and cut into pieces
-   2 cans cream of mushroom or celery soup
-   1 packet onion soup mix

Place roast in 9 x 13 pan. Drain onions and potatoes. Pour them all
around and on top as well as cut carrots. Pour 2 cans of soup on roast
and then onion mix. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for an hour at 325
degrees. Alternatively, use meat thermometer to rare setting (about 130
to 140 degrees).

Serves 8 people.
