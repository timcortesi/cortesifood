 Rachel doesn't remember
where this came from, but it is good.

-   1 cup long-grain white rice
-   1/4 cup cider vinegar
-   1 tablespoon dark rum
-   1/4 cup orange juice
-   2 tablespoons jerk sauce
-   1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
-   4 6-ounce boneless breasts
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon pepper
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 can (15 oz.) black beans, drained and rinsed
-   8 ounces chunk pineapple
-   1 bunch scallions, sliced

Cook the rice as per directions on rice bag. Combine the vinegar, rum,
orange juice, jerk sauce, and ginger in a measuring cup or small bowl;
set aside. Pound the chicken to an even thickness. Season with salt and
pepper. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and
cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from heat and add
the vinegar mixture. Return the skillet to low heat and simmer until the
chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes.

Divide the chicken and sauce among plates. Stir the beans into the rice.
In a medium bowl, combine the pineapple and scallions. Serve both with
the chicken.
