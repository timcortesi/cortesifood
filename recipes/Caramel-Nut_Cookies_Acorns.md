 These are okay if you
like nuts, which I don't. Other people who do like nuts seem to like
them.

-   2 1/2 cups of flour
-   1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
-   1 cup (2 sticks) margarine
-   3/4 cup of packed brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   1/3 cup fine chopped pecans
-   1/2 lb. caramels
-   1/4 cup water
-   Additional chopped pecans (for topping)

Sift together flour and baking powder. Melt butter over low heat, remove
from heat, and stir in brown sugar, vanilla, and pecans. Add dry
ingredients and mix thoroughly. Shape dough into balls using rounded
teaspoonful for each. Flatten one side by pressing on ungreased cookie
sheet. Pinch top point to resemble an acorn. Bake at 350 degrees for
15-18 minutes until golden brown. Cool. Melt caramels and water over
double boiler, (or substitute a 16 oz tub of caramel apple dip, warmed
in the microwave for 1 1/2 min, stirring every 30 sec). Dip flat ends of
cookies into caramel mixture about 1/4" deep. Then dip into pecans. Set
on waxed paper to "dry".

Makes 3 1/2 dozen cookies.
