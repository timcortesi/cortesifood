brownies.

Brownie Mixture: Mix brownie mix batter as directed on box (using
approx: 1 egg, oil, and water).

Cream Cheese Filling: Combine remaining 2 eggs, cream cheese, vanilla,
and sugar. Beat really well.

Assemble: Spread 1/2 of brownie mixture in greased 9" x 13" pan. Pour on
cream cheese mixture; spread to edges. Drop the remaining 1/2 of the
