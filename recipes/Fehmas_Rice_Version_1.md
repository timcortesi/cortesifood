You can always just use regular white (or basmati) rice, but Fehma adds
a few extra spices and vegetables into the rice that she makes. Serve
with [Split Peas and Chicken "Kabobs"](Split_Peas_and_Chicken_Kabobs) .

-   3 cups of basmati brown rice
-   1 large onion, cut angst grain into long, thin slices
-   1 teaspoon red chili pepper powder
-   1 teaspoon garam masala
-   1 1/2 cups frozen peas
-   Olive oil

Cover rice with water and let soak for approximately 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, saute onion in 2 tablespoon of oil in the bottom of a large
pot. Add 6 1/2 cups of water to the onions. Also add red chili pepper
powder, garam masala, and peas. Drain water from the rice and add rice
to onion/spice/pea mixture. Put a lid on the pot and cook on low heat
until the water is gone (approximately 20 minutes).
