 I don't ever
remember us making these, but Rachel says we have and they are good.

-   2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
-   1/2 cup chopped green onion
-   10 flour tortillas (8 inches)
-   2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese, divided
-   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
-   2 cups half and half cream or milk
-   6 eggs, beaten
-   1/4 teaspoon salt, optional

Other optional ingredients: red and green peppers, sweet onions,
mushrooms, taco sauce (medium)

Combine ham and onions, place about 1/3 cup down the center of each
tortilla. Add any other optional ingredients. Top with 2 tablespoons
cheese. Roll up and place seam side down in a greased 9 x 13 dish. In a
bowl, combine flour, cream, eggs and salt if desired until smooth. Pour
over tortillas. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Remove
from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Cover and bake at 350
degrees for 25 minutes. Uncover, bake for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with
remaining cheese, bake 3 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.
Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Optional topping: pico de gallo
or salsa.
