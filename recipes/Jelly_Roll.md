 Very
yummy, and not very difficult. Sure to impress. Instructions for making
a chocolate roll are on the next page.

-   5 eggs ([separated](http://www.graspr.com/videos/Separating-Eggs))
-   1 cup sugar
-   1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
-   2 tablespoons lemon juice
-   1 cup sifted flour
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   Confectioners' sugar
-   1 cup jelly or jam

Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Add 1/2 sugar slowly, beating
constantly. Set aside. Beat egg yolks until thick and lemon colored; add
remaining sugar gradually, continuing to beat until stiff enough to hold
a soft peak; add grated lemon rind and juice.
[Fold](http://www.graspr.com/videos/Folding) yolk mixture gently into
egg whites (or vice versa). Combine flour and salt and fold quickly but
lightly into egg mixture. Spray a cookie sheet lightly with Pam, line it
with waxed paper, generously spray the waxed paper with Pam, then pour
the batter into the pan, spreading evenly. Bake at 350 degrees for 15
minutes. Turn onto clean pastry towel that is generously sprinkled with
confectioner's sugar. Quickly remove waxed paper. Roll up from the
narrow end, with cloth and let set on wire rack, seam side down until
cool (at least 45 min). Unroll, remove towel and spread with whipped
jelly. Re-roll again, and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Garnish
with fruit as desired.

8-10 servings.
