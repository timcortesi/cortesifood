This recipe is for a frozen drink that you can make ahead and then keep
in the freezer. It is excellent.

-   1/2 can (6 oz.) frozen lemonade
-   1/2 can (6 oz.) frozen orange juice
-   6 cups water
-   2 cups tea (i.e. make hot tea using 2 teabags and 2 cups of hot
    water)
-   2 cups sugar
-   1 1/2 cups whiskey

Combine and freeze in tupperware container, stirring occasionally. This
will take about 24 hours to set, so make sure you give yourself enough
time.

Suggestions: Pour in the lemonade & orange juice first, and then add the
hot tea so they cancel each other out. It is also easier to stir in the
sugar if you do it after you already put the tea in. Make sure you use a
large enough container. Seagrams Whiskey works well for this.
