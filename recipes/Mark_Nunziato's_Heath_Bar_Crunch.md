  Mom got
this recipe from a dude at work and says that it is good. It is
basically candy - with a crunch.

-   1 sleeve of saltine crackers (abt 50)
-   1 1/2 sticks of butter (not margarine)
-   1 1/4 cups of brown sugar
-   1 package of semi-sweet chocolate chips

Line cookie sheet with foil. Put a single layer of saltines on the foil
so they are touching, breaking additional saltines in half as needed for
the edges. Melt butter, add sugar, and bring to a rolling boil. Pour
mixture over saltines. Bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes. Remove
from oven and sprinkle chocolate chips over top. Let sit for a minue,
and then as they melt, spread around. Sprinkle with chopped nuts,
crushed peppermint, sprinkles, coconut as desired. Refrigerate, break
apart. Store in air tight container or zip lock bag.
