A staple of any good summer dinner.

-   1 box of elbow macaroni (or abt. 1 1/2 lb - 24 oz)
-   Mayonnaise, to taste (or abt 1 cup +)
-   Sweet pickle relish, to taste (or abt 3/4 cup (6 oz)
-   Chopped baby carrots, to taste (or abt 12)
-   Sweet pickle juice, to taste

Boil water and cook macaroni as directed on box. Drain and rinse pasta
in cold water until cool. Move pasta to large mixing bowl, and add mayo,
relish, and carrots. Taste frequently and keep adding stuff until it
tastes good. Macaroni salad will taste best if you make it the night
before, but you can also eat it right after making it.

Serves 6-8
