This recipe is originally from Cooking Light September 2014, but we made
some modifications. Here is a [link to original recipe on Cooking

When Mom made it she used extra apples and more streusel for the
topping.

Streusel:

-   4 tablespoons old-fashioned rolled oats
-   4 tablespoons flour
-   2 tablespoons brown sugar
-   2 tablespoons butter, melted
-   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Muffins:

-   1 cup flour
-   1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
-   2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
-   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
-   3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk \<-- If you don't have buttermilk you can
    mix 3/4 cup milk with 3/4s of a tablespoon of either lemon juice or
    vinegar, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using.
-   1/2 cup brown sugar
-   2 tablespoons canola oil
-   1 tablespoon butter, melted
-   1 large egg, lightly beaten
-   2 Gala apples, diced (about 2 cups)
-   1/2 cup powdered sugar
-   2 tablespoons maple syrup
-   1/2 teaspoon water

Preheat oven to 400°. Prepare streusel by combining ingredients in a
bowl; set aside. To prepare muffins, combine flours, cinnamon, baking
powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Combine buttermilk, 1/2
cup sugar, oil, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and egg in a bowl. Add
buttermilk mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until combined. Fold
in apple. Divide batter among 12 paper-lined muffin cups; top evenly
with streusel. Bake at 400° for 16 minutes or until a wooden pick
inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging. Cool in pan
5 minutes. Remove from pan; cool completely. Combine powdered sugar,
syrup, and 1/2 teaspoon water in a bowl; stir until smooth. Drizzle
evenly over muffins.
