Mom says this is really good. Rachel says it is vile, but that is only
because she doesn't like shrimp, so her opinion doesn't count. Also
Shrimp Newburg is the really good shrimp thing that Canoe Island Lodge
always has at the end of the buffet table on Saturday night (right
before the meat carving dude).

-   2 tablespoons butter
-   1 1/2 tablespoons flour
-   3/4 teaspoon salt
-   A few grains of cayenne
-   1/2 cup cream
-   1/4 cup milk
-   2 cups cooked shrimp
-   2 egg yolks, beaten
-   2 tablespoons sherry
-   Parsley (optional)
-   Thin strips of pimento (optional)

Melt butter. Add flour, salt and cayenne; whisk well. Whisk in cream and
milk gradually, and bring to a boiling point, stirring constantly. Add
shrimp. Just before serving, add egg yolks and sherry. Garnish with
parsley and thin strips of pimento, if desired.

Yield: 4 servings

Serve on rounds of puff pastry or on rice.
