 This (as the title implies)
is the really good salad we get from Morocco at EPCOT. It goes well with
the Beef Shish Kabobs (in the Main Dishes section).

-   1 cucumber, chopped
-   2 tomatoes, chopped
-   1 teaspoon parsley, finely chopped
-   1 teaspoon cilantro, finely chopped
-   1 oz. olive oil
-   1 oz. vinegar
-   Salt to taste
-   Pinch white pepper
-   1 teaspoon cumin
-   2 tablespoons chopped onions

Mix all ingredients well. Serve chilled for best taste. Goes well with
Beef Shish Kabobs and Couscous Salad.

Serves five.
