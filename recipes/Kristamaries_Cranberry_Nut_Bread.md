 This is the cranberry nut bread
that Kristamarie always makes for Thanksgiving, and it is excellent!

-   2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
-   1 cup sugar
-   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/4 cup butter or margarine
-   1 egg, beaten
-   1 teaspoon grated orange peel
-   3/4 cup orange juice
-   1 cup walnuts, chopped
-   1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries, chopped; or craisins
-   1 cup light raisins (or substitute another cup cranberries or dried
    currants if desired)

  Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda into a
large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Add egg, orange
peel, and orange juice all at once; stir just until mixture is evenly
moist. Fold in walnuts, cranberries, and raisins.   Spoon into a greased
9x5x3" loaf pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or
until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from pan;
cool on a wire rack.

  Makes 1 loaf.
